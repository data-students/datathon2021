Mediterranean cuisine with an Italian touch (the chef is Sicilian) with a very high standard.They change the menu according to season which is much appreciated. I went there for the first time in the summer and it was fresher cuisine, pasta with seafood, fish dishes ... etc. I went back in December and you will find more meat dishes (even game, deer, which is hard to find) which is normal for the time and which shows that they base the kitchen on the product.The elaborations are very elaborate typical of modern cuisine and the combination of tastes is splendid.It is not cheap but with some offers you can find for a reasonable price for the level we are talking about (discounted ‚Ç¨ 40 with wine and dessert).\n",
      "All very well. Food from the menu excellent in every way. Price also very correct. Great site. The service is very good but the waiter lacks an assistant, he is alone and is racing\n",

You can tell that the chef does it with a true devotion to cooking and likes to experiment with fresh and intense flavors. We really loved it and I recommend it 100%The super friendly staff helped us choose the dishes because everything sounded so good that it was almost impossible to decide!We have to go back to try more things.We booked with the fork so we were lucky to enjoy the 40% discount although the price is not super expensive, but it is not a cheap restaurant really. Which is normal because the quality and originality justify the price.\n",

      "They have taken care of us very well and have been interested from the beginning for our satisfaction. The terrace was nice and as one of the diners was uncomfortable in the terrace chair they have changed it for another one from the interior that was more fluffy and comfortable. As for dinner, we have opted for a tasting menu that the three members of the dinner liked. The portions were small (they warn you already) but having 5 dishes the total amount was enough. We found the quality of the food to be excellent and the daring but successful fusion of flavors. To drink we have been recommended a fruity white, fragrant and rich in nuances that perfectly combined with food. The price is in line with the rest of the restaurants in the area (neither cheaper nor more expensive) so, considering that we ate quite well, the experience can be recommended.\n",

It also highlights the excellent treatment of his wife Elena and his kindness and sympathy with the client, very endearing. We took Valentine's tasting menu and we were fascinated. The oysters and their accompaniment of granita with lemon and passion fruit are sublime, as well as the risotto with prawns, the battered rice balls with parmiggiano mash, the scallops or the chocolate coulant. Excellence and quality in all dishes. We will be back.\n",

The only \"downside\" that I can say is that they took a bit of time in everything, to serve us and to serve us. But they were very nice !!! I really highly recommend itüòä\n",
      "Dinner on the terrace in Pla√ßa Sant Felip Neri is something I would never have imagined and it‚Äôs really amazing.You have to be lucky because there are only 3 tables and they don't book, but after an hour of waiting we got it.In addition the spectacular food and the very attentive service. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Best table of our stay in Barcelona !!We recommend +++ very pleasant staff, knowledge of French very valuable.Great advice on white wine! Basa - fruity wineRegarding the dishes, no disappointment.The flavor is there.\n",
      "Wonderful experience in a restaurant decorated with class and seasoned with exquisite music.Good wine pairing offered by this place.Of the dishes tested, I would highlight the rice with a secret, the red shrimp tacos and the oxtail tatin for the flavor and quality of the product.To finish, brutal French toast.We will be back\n",
      "Very very nice discovery, terrace in a very pretty courtyard marked by history, with incredible charm. Short menu of fresh products, little worked and yet revealing original tastes. Nice wine list. A great super address.\n",
      "Avant-garde food, design and unique flavors thanks to chef Nico Del Valle who surprises with the innovation, textures and mix of paella with Iberian secret, shrimp carpaccio and a dessert of torrija with cream and smoked milk ice cream. An incredible evening in a medieval palace very close to the Cathedral of Barcelona.\n",
      "Located in the Plaza de Sant Josep Neri, it is better to visit it during the Summer when the school opposite is closed to enjoy the calm and the extraordinary atmosphere of the place. There you will find exquisite attention, creative and delicious cuisine, which in other places do not always go hand in hand. :-) I would hope they had at least an average of 4.5 reviews, and for that, you have to change it!\n",
      "The place is of historical interest, its state today is unfortunate.OBVIOUSLY I DO NOT REFER TO THE HOLE OF THE FACADE, THE FACT THAT YOU THINK I REFER TO THIS IS VERY OFFENSIVE BUT IT SHOWS YOUR OPINION ON THE CULTURAL LEVELOF CITIZENSHIP that I share\n",
      "Wonderful in a hidden corner. Food and service that we rarely find in the center\n",
      "Very good service\n",
      "Very good service and excellent food, the price drops a bit.\n",
      "Very friendly service and acceptable food quality, but exorbitant prices.\n",
      "They had the terrace with 3 empty tables and STOPS (there were 6 in total) and they told us we couldn't sit because they had full capacity. Luckily we found other restaurants with more desire to be a restaurant.\n",
      "Brutal discovery. All the spectacular dishes, exquisite service. I would recommend it a thousand times.\n",
      "A wonderful experience !! Starting with the setting and the decoration of the place that is fantastic. Attention a 10. All very professional, they were very aware of the table. The dishes came out on time so there was no waiting. Regarding the food, everything is great! I especially recommend the leeks, the rice and the beef tatin. And of course you cannot stop trying the focaccia that they make for you at the moment and it is delicious. 100% recommended this site. I will come back for sure !!\n",
      "The location is perfect in Plaza Sant Felip Neri. The menu is not very extensive but everything is so delicate and delicious. Good wine list. We had a drink on the terrace. Very nice. Very good professionals. Totally recommendable.\n",

      "A perfect restaurant for a good meal, with very elaborate presentations and at very affordable prices.Some of their dishes are so good that we could repeat them every week, in particular pigeon rice, croque monsieur and torrija.If you need to book, ask for the table overlooking Pla√ßa Sant Felip Neri.\n",
      "Finally a wonderful place in the center of Barcelona where you can eat pussy.Between being my favorite square in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthat the food they give you is of quality, modern and at the moment at a more than acceptable price, I am looking forward to going back to what I can.A 10!\n",
      "Fantastic gastronomic experience. Lovely snacks set up with a lovely atmosphere in the backyard. This Spanish dry white wine is to be recommended.\n",
      "Amazing place. Very quiet courtyard in the center of Barcelona. Very unusual serving of food. For us, this restaurant was a revelation. It may well be included in the list of gastronomic attractions.\n",
      "Exquisite food and very good treatment, especially by the waiter Pere\n",
      "Everything was delicious!The concept of dishes to share is very nice.\n",
      "Restaurant located next to a charming little square in the Gothic Quarter. You can see the good work of the team both in the kitchen and in the living room. A letter with an interesting proposal. We let ourselves be advised and it was a success! We started with the roasted leeks and the oxtail tatin, both excellent. We continue with the Iberian secret dry rice and delta razor clams, just right and with an incredible flavor! All accompanied by its focaccia, it is one of those that escapes a tear just by smelling it. And, as a sweet touch, torrija, a surprising and delicious combination of flavors. Eating in this restaurant is quite an experience: enclave and charming atmosphere, impeccable service and cuisine with an undeniable flavor. You cannot ask for more, I recommend it 100%, on my next visit to Barcelona I will repeat for sure.\n",
      "Lovely place and atmosphere. Attentive but very slow service. It is a restaurant that promotes the sharing of dishes between those at the table so you hope to be able to try them all together and not one by one ...\n",
      "Nothing intimate restaurant, is in front of a church and there is always a group of tourists standing in front of the entrance.The service was very friendly and attentive.The food pretty bad, poorly executed dishes, others that taste were not very successful and the rest nothing original.\n",
      "We had dinner on the terrace on a Tuesday night. The treatment, the food and the unbeatable place. There were not many people around the square, just a guitarist playing super nice, and some tourists passing through, so we could enjoy the magic of the place. Being a local from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãI don't usually like to go through areas that are so frequented by tourists, but I must admit that this corner really surprised me. I recommend that you order the bread with red pesto, it may seem simple but it is delicious. Also, don't forget to try the tuna tartare and the grilled octopus. Impressive! To drink we asked for cold tea with homemade lemon, it was very refreshing and rich. I did not know this place and without a doubt I keep it among my favorites in the area around the Cathedral.\n",
      "They have the best amaretto sour I've ever had! Superb bartender attention!\n",
      "Very good attention and that we arrived when cooking was about to close. They treated us great and the food is delicious.\n",
      "Surprising menu in a unique setting as is the Plaza Felip Neri. Cozy place and very good service.\n",
      "Bad personal experience. Lazy attention. Coffee with milk üëé\n",
      "Very nice location, very good food! Highly Recommended!\n",
      "The place is charming, but that unfortunately does not compensate for the emptiness in the plate and the poor service.For the price we expect more.\n",
      "Delicious experience!Excellent service and divine cuisine!In a small square with an overwhelming history, a splendid setting!Thanks to the whole team !!!!!\n",
      "Nefarious treatment. Slow Expensive. I do not recommend it even to look at the menu. A pity that in such a fantastic place there is such a poorly used place.\n",
      "Experience at the top executive awesome, 4 stars at the price of an average restaurant. Awesome !\n",
      "Restaurant with a magnificent location in the heart of old Barcelona.It does not have many tables.You can order individual and shared dishes.Fair rations.Improved value for money.Service can also be improved.This restaurant is inside the Neri Hotel.\n",
      "Great! Local prices and very good food. The truth is that we could not say anything bad. We were thinking we would eat well, but we came out very happy. The service is slow, but because they are missing a person. All great, a 10!\n",
      "The treatment has been very good and all the dishes we have tried are of excellent quality. The bread is essential and the cheeks incredible. The highly recommended salmon dish.The terrace in the square is formidable.\n",
      "Stranger in my house.We went there with my partner. The restaurant is intended for foreign tourists. None of the waiters knew Catalan, who attended us knew a Spanish fair. The rest, not even Spanish, spoke directly to us in English.It took them an hour and a half to bring us the first course after they had complained if they had forgotten about us.Fair food.What a pity that St. Felip Neri with the story behind it.It is very sad what Barcelona is becoming\n",
      "Very friendly staffThe price of food is highYou can order a cup of coffee on the terrace.\n",
      "Very good restaurant ....\n",
      "Very nice restaurant which overlooks a very nice little square in the heart of the Gothic, the staff is very caring, pleasant and the cuisine is just sublime, we loved it, Gastronomic at a very affordable price, we will definitely come back\n",
      "The terrace is lovely, definitely one of the magical corners of Barcelona to sit down and have a few drinks with friends, but unfortunately not for dinner. The foie mousse was delicious but I can not say the same for the cod fritters or the oxtail cannelloni, so the quality / price ratio is not the best.\n",
      "Magnificent, good food and good care\n",
      "LOW honesty.Charging you for a water Send at ‚Ç¨ 6.50 is to be cheeky and have 0 honesty.I think they know that no one will expect that price for a water, so it would have been appreciated if they reported the price earlier.\n",
      "A quiet space and exquisite dishes.\n",
      "Pleasant surprise, without a doubt we will repeat.\n",
      "New discovery in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa beautiful corner. All the exquisite dishes and do not forget to ask for fresh bread. Unbeatable treatment. Good wine list and coffee and drink on the hotel terrace. We will repeat for sure.\n",
      "Excellent choice to eat this Sant Jordi.We have chosen the \"legendary\" menu recommended by the person who attended us, and it was perfect, several dishes to share, along with the drink and at a very reasonable price.For us we already want to repeat.You, if you want a quiet place, a pleasant place and good food, you already know where to go.\n",
      "Traditional essence restaurant with signature reinterpretation in the heart of Barcelona. Undoubtedly one of the best options in the city if you want to be surprised with sincere cuisine proposals without additions.\n",
      "Very cozy and good cuisine\n",
      "All exquisite !!\n",
      "Very nice site. Good food, good treatment and good wine!\n",
      "Sublime Christmas lunch! What about location with attention to every detail, pleasant and kind staff. Very accurate service. Christmas menu in such a location at an affordable and truly incredible price. Each dish expertly prepared each product used and of the highest quality. Amazing shrimp TARTARE rice with mouth-watering Pigeon. I don't want to describe each portion because it would be a succession of praise. Well done and thank you for a fantastic Christmas!\n",
      "Exquisite cuisine, incredible location, in the gotic of Barcelona\n",
      "Excellent service, presentation of dishes and defined flavors. To come back\n",
      "Very attentive staff, the correct service, the rations to share a little fair. But everything we asked was very good. And of acceptable price.\n",
      "A lot of charm in a place with a lot of history such as Plaza St Felip Neri. The torrija is incredible\n",
      "Happy with the service received.\n",
      "Restaurant that we expected more, for its decoration, atmosphere and the head of the kitchen.The slow service, the small portions and dishes that arrived cold on the table.Good food but I refer to what I have mentioned before, small.For this reason I put 2 stars.In summary good restaurant in the Gothic quarter but the price for tourists.\n",
      "Going to lunch at the Neri's restaurant accompanied by M. Espinet and enjoying the menu renewed by chef Alain Guiard is an unusual pleasure that makes the meeting extraordinary. The dishes are sensational and the perfect service. The price is not cheap, but it is clear that I will not go there every day (or every month unfortunately for me!) If you can go to the bar table, which has a large glass that faces the Plaza Sant Felip Neri (at noon patios of the Neri School)\n",
      "It is very rustic. Then, once you enter, it is very cozy. It was a complete dessert unlike some complementary desserts that mark special occasions\n",
      "-Rations small.-Quality average.-Preus high.-Pay lamented (I do not blame the waiters, since you have to be fucked to work for 4 hard ones in a job you do not enjoy to win to live). It is worrying that some restaurants are looking for cheap labor that do not understand restoration and want to be local quality with high prices only.Restaurants like that, left over in Barcelona.\n",
      "Great place very cozy placeThe staff are very pleasant and professional we had a great time it is really a place to test! It‚Äôs very good fresh products but a little expensive all the same\n",
      "A beautiful place, a good deal and the kitchen impeccable, reasonably priced, ideal to share, the oysters and the divine scallops and the rest including the perfect apple pie, we will return\n",
      "Currently, for the obvious COVID reasons, the rest. It is limited. But the service and bar attention are still optimal.\n",
      "Cozy atmosphere A little delay in serving some dishes, most of these strength achieved. The wine list, as it happens in many places, is inflated.\n",
      "Spectacular food, and to give thanks for the service from start to finish. It's nice how he treats you from the head of the room to the last waiter, everything very well. The truth has never been but we will return when we have another meeting with our colleagues from London.\n",
      "The staff is one of the super friendly and more than helpful. The food is on the next level, how beautiful it is is not to mention the explosion of flavor from the first bite to the last.\n",
      "Unprofessional staff, designed for tourists. They do not speak or understand Catalan. Mostly they are expressed in English. Summarizing: Designed by people from outside Catalonia.\n",
      "The food was fresh and delicious. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and family. Fair rates and generous portions\n",
      "The taste of spring! All foods are well presented and delicious. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I really liked it. Refinement of appetizers and good wine. Great surroundings. I advise you to try.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant in a corner of the center of Barcelona. The food is delicious with different flavors and the service was really great. The place itself is ideal for a special dinner and they even have a terrace. The prices are somewhat high but totally justified by the type of dishes they serve.\n",
      "Magnificent dinner everything we ordered was recommended by the waiter since it was the first time we visited the establishment, and it could not be more successful, although I am sure that whatever it was everything would be delicious, mouthfuls to close my eyes and cover me the face of how good everything was, my thousand and one congratulations to the whole team, the place has a thousand recesses where to look and be fascinated by the colors and textures that are in all the decoration without doubt now my favorite place in Barcelona ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è\n",
      "Very poor service. They do not have proffesional people to attend the tables. You have to wait a long time to be cared for. I don't plan to go back. Tip for the owner: hire better professional camera service and maybe pay more ??? Because the restaurant and the place deserve it.\n",
      "Excellent menu, designed to share dishes among diners. Lobster tartare and croquettes with salmon are delicious. The place has a formidable atmosphere and its location in Pla√ßa Sant Felip Neri makes it even more round. For dinner, the tranquility is absolute.\n",
      "Overrated In a cozy place like this, you can see the excess value they give to your kitchen.Abstain those who after the meal ask for a Gin Tonic. We paid ‚Ç¨ 15 for the glass + 2‚Äô5 supplement for the tonic. When we told the waiter he told us that they would put it on the letter for the next time (with me they don't count).\n",
      "A really special lunch today with friends. Excellent service\n",

      "I can not get enough. Perfect in my opinion.\n",

The price is wonderful. Try the ice cofee is very good. üòâ The best place to eat visiting Park Guell.\n",

      "Good food but prices too high\n",
      "the owner or manager too self-centered, wanting to make friends with everyone and take pictures, I don't know if he is there to attend or to guide the city and learn languages. The food is not so much, a sandwich with sausage, scarce, 2 ham fillets at most\n",

      "Excellent food. The waiter was not very attentive in the order and he put us a table of sausages larger than the one we had ordered, I said it at the time of paying and it was ignored. I don't think a waiter's mistake has to be paid for by the customer. You have to improve on that, otherwise, everything is great.\n",

      "Beautiful place and very nice staff.\n",
      "A different way to continue enjoying Italian gastronomyI have had the opportunity to taste the gastronomy of this small but cozy place and I must admit that the freshness of its ingredients make note a quality flavor in each biteAll the staff is Italian and the decoration is very well set in that old style, which makes you have an old movie experience while you eat their delicious schiacciata\n",
      "EXCELLENT. A magical place in the heart of the Born. Snacks with a kind of focaccia with quality sausages cut at the moment, delicious. The tables of incredible Italian sausages too. Small place but mandatory stop.\n",
      "Absolutely no waiter wears the mask properly, all below the chin. Something that gives bad vibes especially when you are handling food, cutting cheese, sausage, etc. In addition, the waiter is exaggeratedly slow, and being only us in the bar he has asked us to repeat the order because it had not been clear to him. He has made a mistake in one of the sandwiches, which he has had to repeat, and in another he has changed an ingredient because they did not have it (and he did not warn). I put two entrellas on it just because the food is very good and of high quality. But perhaps better to wait for the covid to be more relaxed to come. The waiters go without a mask and the customers also come in without a mask and do not ask them to put it on. It is incredible to see that a sector that has suffered so much from this pandemic takes prevention measures so lightly.\n",
      "Some time ago my wife wants to go and try Narciso's sandwiches and I have to say that it is an excellent place to eat a good sandwich prepared with Italian products of very good quality. The bread of the sandwiches outstanding and very well attended by a super nice girl. Completely recommended.\n",
      "Excellent Italian panini's, accompanied by a friendly and attentive service through its employees, plus the place is very good, they have left it so you can see the old foundations. All together makes it a great option to stop during the day to make a rest stop and good taste.\n",
      "I was very curious to try this place for a long time and it has fulfilled all expectations!The cheese platters and spectacular sausages!\n",
      "Excellent service! Very tasty food!\n",
      "A great place for high quality cold cuts, cheeses and wines! Very well located between the center and the born, and super cozy! I recommend it!!! ü§ó\n",
      "INCROYAAAAAAAAAABLE GRACIAS PABLOOO\n",
      "Extraordinary place !! The food is great as well as the treatment !!\n",
      "If you are looking for an Italian where they DO NOT serve the typical Bolognese or carbonara pasta, this is your place\n",
      "The interior was excellent, it was delicious, but the foccacia was hard to eat, a mixture of stale bread and gum bread at the same time. A shame because it completely lowers the quality of the other product that is great and makes you not be able to enjoy it.\n",
      "Tiny and cool bar\n",
      "The cheese board is delicious! ;) The service is very friendly!\n",
      "Small place, half open to Calle Princesa.They are open until two in the morning and they make some delicious focaccias with porchetta !!!\n",
      "All delicious! We went for brunch and we really liked it. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I have ordered a schiacciata that they have prepared for me with very little affection. It's a shame that they changed the service they used to offer. My take out order was cold and full of oil. I was very excited to go eat it because I had very good memories of it.\n",
      "Magnificent and well-kept place to eat and drink wonderful Italian gastronomy, very friendly staff.\n",
      "Great! The charcuterie and wines are a great selection! üòç quality sandwiches for delivery!\n",

      "Spectacular! Good service and very good food.\n",
      "Delicious and the boys are lovely. I will repeat\n",
      "We have been going to Blavis for many years. It is one of those little secrets that you would like no one to know so that you can always enjoy it. Small place (four tables) with a lot of charm with a very friendly and close staff (Mark and Paco). Their love and passion for cooking is reflected in each of the dishes they prepare. Always innovating to satisfy the palates of all customers and friends who will always enjoy good food. Dishes very well prepared and presented at the right prices. The wine list is wide and varied, always with fantastic new wines. It‚Äôs worth trying the recommendations of the day off the letter. Desserts are often changed and adapted to the tastes and flavors of the season.\n",
      "Spectacular!!! Quite a discovery! Although at first the place is small and simple, they surprise with all the dishes, different, delicious and of a high quality. In addition, the treatment is very close and they are very dedicated to explaining the menu and the dishes of the day. Highly recommended, tornarem :)\n",
      "Simply spectacular, tiny and very cozy restaurant. Dishes made with care and of a very high quality that makes it one of our favorite restaurants in Barcelona. Very good for take away during the pandemic, even though we miss going to dinner again. I would recommend the mountain rice, the croquettes, the bravas and the tomato bread.\n",
      "Without doubt one of our favorite restaurants in Barcelona. Although it is difficult to find a table, (it is necessary to book weeks in advance due to the small size of the place), it is worth it.The personal treatment coupled with the great quality of its cuisine makes the experience unforgettable. Perfect for a couple dinner in a cozy atmosphere.\n",
      "The place is a very small place, simple, but cozy, the menu was curiously chosen and with very rich and elaborate dishes, the quantities are not the most abundant, but I think that the quality price is compensated.Above all, something that for me is essential in a restaurant and that in this place is excellent and that is why I give 5 stars is the attention together with the good knowledge of their dishes and wines.\n",
      "I booked my visit a couple of days ago and finally had a great meal. The most enjoyable and happy memories I have had in Barcelona.\n",
      "Excellent service. Meals better than a Michelin star. Reasonable price quality as well as wine list.Both Paco and Marc are great professionals.\n",
      "Really good, great selection of tapas. We had a great time. Excellent staff, very relaxing atmosphere. surely we will come back :)\n",
      "The treatment is very close and personal. The menu is made with great care and the dishes are a delicacy. It is best to let yourself be recommended and enjoy every bite. We have already gone 3 times and it is always a success and a delight.\n",
      "Excellent service and good food but neither the premises nor the portions justify the price.\n",
      "Great value for money. It's worth booking and going to enjoy. They are also very friendly.\n",
      "Simply delicious and unbeatable treatment.\n",
      "I visited the restaurant because it ranked 2nd to 6th in the TripAdvisor rating, but it is not a big restaurant, but the boss is very kind.There are various menus, but the boss explains them one by one, so it is very easy to choose. The boss recommends 3 to 5 per 2 people, but if you are hungry, you eat this and the food is served slowly, so you get more and more hungry. We ate 7 foods in 4 families and all were fullThe price was very good, so I ate 7 foods and 4 glasses of sangria-like wine and cola water, but the price was around 60 euroIt is recommended to go once!\n",
      "I was impressed with the professionalism of the server. It is a place where you can have a kind and delicious meal.\n",

      "The experience at Blavis was great, impeccable attention, Paco explained the menu to us in detail, answered our questions kindly and gave us accurate and delicious recommendations.I think it is essential to try the Aubergine carpaccio, all the dishes were delicious but that one is at the top!Blavis is a place with few tables and you may have to wait a few weeks for your reservation but it is worth it and even exceeds it.100% recommended for both couples and a small group of friends :)\n",

      "An unforgettable experience. From the first moment to the last they make you enjoy, standing above my expectations. The avant-garde menu includes a wide variety of dishes, all of them delicious and in some cases surprising, which is to be welcomed. The amount is adequate, making you more than satisfied. Being able to see the kitchen, the decoration of the room, the terrace and the good service do leave you wanting to return. In summary, absolutely recommendable\n",

      "Galician, how could it be otherwise: Very friendly, perfect daily menu in quality and quantity, all homemade and with a very rich product that shows.I love having found this place in the neighborhood!\n",
      "I have to especially highlight the attention, since both the waiters and (I suppose it is) the owner gave it to us in a very good way.We ordered salad and cod croquettes (there were no squid left, I imagine they will be in high demand). Both pretty good things.To share cachopo, I have to say that it is of a very generous size and perfectly enough to share two, as the waiter recommended. It was good and the potatoes that accompany it are homemade but I think it has a minute of fried left over. With a little less it would have been perfect!The only thing that left me with a bittersweet taste was the price of the glass of wine, which considering that there is no variety ... I think it does not match the quality.A good and familiar Galician restaurant, we recommend!P.S. They don't have the menu on weekends\n",
      "Incredible, a delicious ham with a wine chosen by the house that denotes the quality of the place\n",
      "Restaurant with excellent quality products, very well cooked, at an ideal price for the quality they serve you.The treatment always unbeatable and very, very attentive.The prevention measures for COVID are more than correct.And just one thing, if someone is on a diet, to refrain from going to eat; it is impossible not to try all the \"delicacies\" that they cook.Thank you very much for the quality and the treatment received.\n",

      "Excellent rice. Great master chef. Congratulations.\n",
      "Only when you arrive do you feel that special atmosphere that is breathed between elegance and Mediterranean accentuated by the kindness of the room staff, very attentive and with a natural sympathy, In addition to the professionalism of the same cooks who came out to explain their dishes to us in detail and move us the good work and elaboration behind each one.I loved the dishes. I love when a dish reminds you of a particular moment and brings you feelings and that is just what I felt with the seasonal rice with sea urchin and truffle that literally transported me to the first day of summer.Another dish that impressed me a lot was the amberjack with pistachio, caviar and perfect ponzu sauce, both aesthetically and for its flavor.The wine pairing is also excellent, all very particular and perfectly served according to each dish and flavor.Without a doubt a place that I recommend and where I would return\n",
      "A place with two Michelin stars, combining excellent and well-selected ingredients with a well thought-out menu. The place is exquisitely stylish and prestigious and there is no room for criticism. Instead, the service did not fully meet the requirements of a two-Michelin star: a vegetarian diner was served with chicken broth and in some places, dirty plates were left unchanged between clean portions.The situation, though, was matched by an excellent sommelier and carefully selected wines that were perfect for the menu.However, as a whole, we felt that the service and price did not reach the level of two Michelin stars and therefore four stars. The two M star restaurants are already waiting for almost perfection in the service and can therefore be paid a premium price.\n",
      "Excellent dining experience. A tasting menu that is worthwhile, creative and with the best seasonal produce. The treatment and professionalism of the staff, also very good. The 2 Michelin stars are well deserved.\n",
      "Wonderful. Of the restaurants of great chefs that we have visited, the two of Paco P√©rez (Miramar and Enoteca) are the ones that have made me enjoy more with their flavors.The most outstanding dishes of the tasting menu are the lemon fish tartare, the yuzu dessert, mango and lime and above all, the star for me was rice with crayfish. Spectacular!Very attentive service and location, next to the sports dog of Barcelona is ideal.It deserves the third star.\n",
      "Fantastic tasting menu.\n",
      "Never taste anything so good, many dishes\n",
      "It is expensive, but you can taste the high grade course meal. The seafood and truffles were a new experience because I could feel the delicate flavors of the mouth.\n",
      "A deserved two-star michelin restaurant in Barcelona. Located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Olympic Village and nestled in the Hotel Arts, it stands out for the quality of its cuisine, the professionalism of its staff. The impeccable facilities for its warm decoration, perfect order, pleasant distribution of spaces. Very bright place and perfectly oriented to the port. Spectacular tasting menu: very elaborate and perfectly presented. The ‚Äúmeter‚Äù and the ‚Äúsomelier‚Äù stand out, perfectly accompanied by a young, very professional and perfectly organized team. I am very pleasant, respectful and attentive without being overwhelming. ... a solid two star with more claims ...\n",
      "Spectacular !! .. enjoying with all the senses .... I recommend accompanying everything with a special wine, the K22.\n",
      "All the dishes, very good. Good service\n",
      "In my life I have had the opportunity to try some gastronomic and starred restaurants but none like Enoteca.The atmosphere is sophisticated, modern but so comfortable and welcoming that I felt at home.From the first moment we arrived at the restaurant, the attention and care by the room staff have been exquisite.For me it is the small details that make the difference and the consistency of the service has met everything that a two-star service demands.The food was technically super well executed, each item cooked to perfection, on a fairly balanced menu, with dishes that were elegant and bursting with flavor. It stands out from the other homologous restaurants by its respect and ennoblement of the best seasonal product in a version of comfort food, without ever losing the kindness that characterizes the plates of a gastronomic restaurant. It was a journey through the 5 senses.We have done wine pairing and highly recommend it. Each wine had a connection with each dish, complementing each other without ever stealing the prominence of the food and vice versa.Thanking all the living room and kitchen team is not enough in proportion to the good time we have lived, and it will surely remain in my memory. Still, thanks for raising the bar. It will be hard to beat!\n",
      "I don't know what they offer but for the price of the menu I prefer to go out to eat elsewhere.\n",
      "Very rich everything\n",
      "Not worth the money spent\n",
      "Life style party. The menus that were changed were not very good. The menus at the time of the visit were both art and texture. The server is also very friendly, and it has all the menus and expertise in wine.\n",
      "An excellent dining experience.Endless wine list but your Sommelier will be a great help to choose from.Excellent quality and flavor. Unbeatable serviceA great detail was to offer us desserts as a gift, for a minimum delay in service. A detail to be thankful that not all restaurants have.\n",
      "Awesome !!! The Paco P√©rez kitchen is a 10, highly recommended ...\n",
      "An exceptional experience in a broad sense of the word, quality, creativity, service, etc. ENHORABONA for your work.\n",
      "Of the best restaurants I have visited. High quality and impeccable ssrvei. It is the second time I visit it, the first with a tasting menu and the second a la carte. It's exquisite. It's worth going there.\n",
      "A tasting menu, as we expected, fantastic.A creative and quality cuisine.\n",
      "Price per diner approximately 400 euros, there I leave it for the brave, the dishes are very elaborate but I left the place hungry, thankfully I had food in the home fridge, a plate of asparagus 60 euros, coffee at 7 euros, a beer 8, etc ... I really shouldn't even have a michelin star, the place is simple, I have been to restaurants with more style, I do not know, I prefer to pay 40 euros and eat a chuleton, at least you savor it and You leave full.\n",
      "Anything that explains here is going to fall short of reality and it would also be a SPOILER for anyone who comes to live the experienceThe restaurant has 2 Michelin stars and it is for something. Tasting menu and without hesitation I recommend doing it together with the wine pairing: they are worth it, really. It is a pasture, the most expensive thing you will ever pay for eating (NEVER!), Things as they are, but it is an experience that if you do it, you have to do it well at all! So throw yourself at least once in a lifetime!Has rice been one of the BEST DISHES I HAVE TESTED IN MY LIFE? surely. That the JEAN LEON 1997 red wine has been one of the best wines I've ever had? Too.It has been an experience: the food, the attention, the explanations, the stay ... We have been having dinner for more than three hours and would start again from the beginning! It has flown by!\n",
      "Two Michelin-star restaurants, creative molecular cuisine, not many but many. There are many waiters, and the speed of serving is slow, from 8:30 to 12:30.\n",
      "The truth is that the restaurant has not surprised me, the dishes are arriving with good times but they have not told me anything, even some of them were out of salt. Another thing that I find hard to understand is going to a restaurant called Enoteca and from the entire wine list, a tocho de carte, I'm just going to choose a wine that doesn't exist, it seems like a joke; I think that a wine bar is a place specialized in wines and that if any are missing from the menu, they should comment a priori. Finally, the price seems to me completely disproportionate in relation to the experience I have had, ‚Ç¨ 840 for 4 people, not anywhere near that. The attention of the staff is very correct. I will not return nor recommend it.\n",
      "Okay, but....The place is very nice, with excellent service. We took the chef's menu and the quality of the food was very good, although the four diners agreed that the desserts, to our liking, did not keep the level of the rest of the menu (although you can not fault the point technical). Nor do I think it is typical of a two Michelin-starred restaurant that when we requested a second bottle of wine they told us that they no longer fit and we had to change wine.My feeling was good but I was left with the impression that the price paid was excessive. I have not felt this perception in other restaurants of the same level\n",
      "Excellent cuisine, adequate wine list, a bit 'complicated confirmation of booking.\n",
      "The restaurant is very elegant and the treatment can not be more exquisite. I took it with little notice and still there were places, not like the abaac, enjoy or other two stars that have a waiting list. They are 16 dishes (including desserts) are quite a few dishes in relation to others of this places that include only 8 to 10 dishes and the price is 190 euros the tasting menu with water 7 euros more so almost 200 per person . The glass of wine told us it would cost about 20 euros although it usually comes out more than the entire bottle. Their dishes are inspired by the sea, and some are quite creative and others more normal, so to speak. It is the first restaurant with stars that I go to, but I have to say that I do not notice any difference between a menu of 50 or 60 euros to this one in terms of creativity, and flavors. I think it's like everything, reached a point of quality what is paying is prestige. For example I have bags of Gucci or qsl cost Zara and brands such as firm and coast, and I do not notice difference between these high-end to high-high, I think what you pay is the \"brand.\" Desserts I did not like. I saw them very normal but the rest of the dishes in general very rich! It lasts about three hours in the whole menu!\n",
      "This week we have reserved a table for 10 people, a written response ... minimum expense of ‚Ç¨ 9,000, obviously we have canceled the reservation.If a table for 10 is an impediment, it is better to say it directly than to cast yourself in this way.You must think if you play the lottery ...Sobrados no! Super enough!\n",
      "2 Michelin stars during my last visit, very good molecular cuisine and sense of service\n",
      "We ate very well, exorbitant prices, the place neither went nor fa ... coffee at 6 euros and star damm beers at 8 ... menus of 180 ... pairing of 110 ... good food, but very expensive ...\n",
      "You eat simply great ... exquisite and delicate treatment\n",
      "Restore a whole cinema eat nothing good Avoided its not worth the price at all\n",
      "Wonderful place! Good food, great atmosphere! Very good!\n",
      "A thousand thanks to Pasqual and his partner for this impeccable service! Beyond the spectacular dishes - the presentation and the work of the waiters give you even better taste!\n",

The dishes are well presented and very good! I liked everything ! The place is clean and tidy. The background music is soft and allows you to chat in peace The cocktails are very good!

Nothing like tasting a good dish from one's land. Some detail with the octopus a little past and burned. The black roast of the best I've had, although being a very thick cut in the center the meat was a little dry but the sauce made up for it. Variety of desserts correct. Three types of cheese, very good.Nice atmosphere. Separate tables give pleasure that there are as separations in the living room.\n",

      "I loved the concept of the Venezuelan food menu merged with the Spanish.Excellent place, good atmosphere, relaxed, good attention.Value very good price!We ordered trio of mini cachapas with white cheese and pork (it was one of my favorites)Then tostones arrechos, the aioli sauce to eat the tostones a combination of flavorsNext dish Ceviche de prawns (there was no photo) sometimes when you forget to take pictures is that you are having such a good time and enjoying the food.And finally the salty dish was the burrata with divine avocado the combination, the only thing I did not like was the tomato sponge cake on top of the burrata, when I ate it I felt that I was chewing a sponge full of egg I didn't feel the tomato my perception does not mean that it was bad)And then we had to close with sweet a traditional Venezuelan dessert like quesillo but here they merged it with unique flavors simply divine!I loved the place, they have 2 years in Barcelona100% recommending, a place to know a culture full of unique flavors\n",
      "Excellent food, very pleasant customer service. I have recommended it since I met it 8 months ago, just when they opened and today I continue to recommend it without a doubt. Excellent price quality. The dishes in the photos are: beef tenderloin with sweet potato (perfect cooked meat and good quality) and Tuna with guacamole and tomato (very good mixture and cooking). We will keep repeating.\n",
      "We thought the food was very good, we tried the teque√±os, arepitas tapas and the rib tapas at low temperature. Something to highlight is the attention they have is fantastic. 10 would definitely return\n",

      "üíõüíô‚ù§ (authentic) I loved the dishes, the excellent attention, a very friendly Venezuelan boy, the only thing that should be improved is that the portions are larger, it is known that some dishes are tasting but in the same way it would be a I like to add more. Regards...\n",

      "I loved this place, because it is a fusion of Venezuelan with other cultures, but without losing the Venezuelan. The cachapa is.the madness and the.papw√±o with lemon really good. First time I had visited him. And a very good service\n",
      "Delicious food\n",
      "Good dishes\n",
      "DO NOT ASK FOR BRAVAS POTATOES. The poorly poached, poorly cooked potato, the brava sauce leaves much to be desired, plus it was served cold from the fridge.Fortunately the rest of the food was decent. The cachapa montadito: good for the filling, but bad for the cachapa.The Teque√±os charge them per unit, which seems a bit usurious to me.Conclusion: I will not return, also very expensive for the real quality.\n",
      "Beautiful restaurant with the best of Venezuelan flavors. Their employees are friendly, smiling and caring for you. The food is amazing and reasonably priced ... the quesillo is just another world! Thanks for bringing a little piece of Venezuela ‚ù§Ô∏è\n",

      "Excellent food! Many flavors.You shouldn't get up from the table without trying the teque√±os, and the montaditos de arepas and cachapas. You can order them per unit. So it is a top option for your entrees.The prawn ceviche is also a good choice to share.If you are going to try the hamburgers, remember to ask for the point of the meat. If not, they will bring it to you VERY done. They have never asked us (at least us).Suckling pig leg is a delight that they cook for 16 hours. It is not the same as a suckling pig in Segovia, but it is a good treat in the center of the city of Barcelona.Go ahead and enjoy. We booked at 9:30 (we were on time) and left there almost at 00:00.\n",
      "A very attentive service at all times and above all very nice. Amazing food, we were a group of 8 people so we asked for a bit of everything to share and to try as many dishes as possible. Highly recommended\n",

      "It is a very cozy place, once you visit it, you will surely return. The food is incredibly good, I have eaten twice and both times I have been positively surprised by the flavors and ideas of this cuisine. Totally recommendable\n",
      "The medium or pinto is warm. In its decoration, in the friendly treatment and, above all, in the food. Lunch menu for 15 euros deliciously warm. One of the best in the area. We will repeat.\n",
      "Found by chance, this nice little place a stone's throw from Parc Guell. All very kind, fantastic foodThe seafood pappardelle was sublime, the delicate and soft grilled tuna melted in the mouth. All accompanied by bread with tomato and an excellent olive oil, which accentuated the goodness of the food. Unfortunately we were unable to taste or sweets, because we had an appointment. Certainly I highly recommend a visit and even a phone call to check the availability of seats. üòç\n",
      "We came about 3 months ago for the first time and we have already repeated about 5 times. The cuisine is 100% Italian with fresh Italian products. They have fresh, artisanal pasta, Italian tap beer and strong local beer bottles from Italy, including Ichnusa, which I love. We have already tried quite a bit and will be back until we try the whole menu. The veal carpaccio is very good and comes in large quantities, the antipasti with spectacular sausages, especially the pistachio mortadella, the delicious pasta, both the typical Sardinian pasta, and the parpadelle ai frutti di mare. Today we tasted a pasta with spicy chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãand also delicious. They don‚Äôt have pizzas but they do have meat and fish seconds, which we haven‚Äôt tried yet. The desserts are homemade, notably Tiramisu and a lemon sorbet with cava. We usually pay about 30 ‚Ç¨ / pax without wine.\n",
      "Very good, the pasta and tapas nickel! super pretty place, unfortunately very small inside but the terrace very good üëåüèº the server very nice compared to the waitress.\n",
      "Small restaurant located near Park G√ºell. The interior has few tables, but it has a very nice and spacious terrace. Ideal for hot days.Very attentive and friendly service. Somewhat slow.On the menu you will find great tapas to share and more elaborate dishes. It is Mediterranean and Sicilian food.Good size portions, rich flavor and good presentation. Everything we ordered was very tasty. Especially the pasta and the cannoli for dessert.If you are in the area, do not hesitate to visit it !!\n",
      "We have gone to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday at Terra Mia and we couldn't have chosen a better place! We spent an incredible afternoon on the terrace and the food was spectacular (from starter to dessert)! We will surely return with great pleasure to enjoy this great discovery in Barcelona more times. Once again, we thank Mari and Duglas for being so kind. It was a very special day! ‚ô• Ô∏èüôèüèΩ\n",
      "Italian restaurant with a great terrace, varied dishes, tapas, pizzas, pasta ... All correct. Lunch menu for ‚Ç¨ 12.5 very complete, 2 courses, dessert and drink. Everything's fine. Friendly service. A good place to have breakfast, a snack or a meal, at a good price with good quality.\n",
      "Wonderful food, excellent service, the terrace is the best for the summer. The cod is awesome, all the pastas amazing. Very recommendable. Excellent price quality\n",
      "Good place to have a few beers with your colleagues, you can easily park your motorbike and car, behind the bar there is a small sand field and it is full of blue / green area. The waiters are very nice people and have an Italian cane beer (Peroni) which is not bad at all! We have been there three or four times and will continue to go there\n",
      "Excellent experience of a carefully designed menu with typical Catalan and other dishes. Excellent service where they explained the dishes to us when serving them and a pairing that accompanies spectacularly well\n",
      "We had the opportunity to have dinner at this restaurant to celebrate my friend's birthday. The place which is located in a large hotel is very pleasant, intimate and cozy.The reception staff is made up entirely of women who are very professional. The service staff was made up today only of men, the restaurant deserves to offer more parity. They were very professional too.As for the dishes, we took the full menu for a meal that lasts about 3:30. It is a real taste marathon that takes us on a journey.This restaurant deserves its 2 Michelin stars.\n",
      "Restaurant with Two Michelin Stars located inside the Mandarin Oriental hotel (5 stars), run by chef Ra√∫l Balam and Carme Ruscalleda. The tasting menu is thematic. There is a shorter option, I took the long menu. Unusual and surprising combinations, together with raw material of indisputable quality and excellent technique. Appetizers, quite good. Vegetable ceviche, impressive. Scallop, spectacular. Lamb, brutally good. Foie, surprising. Turbot, exquisite. Iberian feather, excellent. Preposter, very original. Desserts, surprising. Petit four, forceful. The treatment of staff is excellent. The chef (very close and friendly) stops by the tables, to talk to the customer and ask about the experience (much appreciated in this type of restaurant). Highly recommended !!\n",
      "Brutal !! An experience to enjoy with friends and partner bread !!\n",
      "Great environment and service I will come again if I have a chance.\n",
      "The atmosphere is very pleasant as it has very indirect lighting that allows you to \"lower\" brightness and ambient noise.Few tables, maybe about 20, allowing for some \"intimacy.\"The exquisite and pleasant treatment, without being burdensome, by staff and the master.The dishes, real sets of textures, looked great to me, as did the ‚Äúentertainments‚Äù that change with the season.It‚Äôs expensive yes, but one knows what ‚Äútype‚Äù of restaurant is treading. Traditional touches, such as for dessert the stick of puff pastry and angel hair reminiscent of the traditional cakes of Sant Pol and other Catalan towns or the sauce inspired by the medieval cuisine of Sant Sov√≠ that I took with the my fish, brought directly from Ibiza.For me a spectacular experience!\n",
      "Very nice !!! An entire experience that must be done once in a lifetime! :)\n",
      "Michelin 2 ‚òÖ RestaurantMOMENTS in MANDARIN hotelA special experience where the food was delicious and the service was the best13 courses over 4 hours,It was a special day because it was snowing in Barcelona where it was hard to snow.The staff was also very friendly, so I felt like I was being treated properly.The stomach was so full, but I ate it slowly and ate it one by oneIn particular, the shrimp dishes served with fish and bread cooked with sesame seeds were delicious :)He visitado el restaurante Michelin de 2 estrellas, 'MOMENTS' end Mandarin hotel.¬°Que deliciosa y bonita comidas!\n",
      "Spectacular food, must be tried. The place is right even though it has no views. Very attentive service but not always available.\n",
      "Cozy atmosphere, impeccable service and proximity despite the \"rigidity\" of these types of restaurants. Long menu with exquisite dishes, and with a longed-for reunion of a dish from Sant Pau. Congratulations!\n",
      "Good prices and very good food, we tried the oxtail rabiolis and the caramelized calzots with honey and the potato soup with ribs, all delicious, the service was great\n",
      "The presentation of the dishes is beautiful! But unfortunately, the relationship between jet lag and the Spanish dinner started very late. There were many dishes but I fell asleep at the end.\n",
      "A WONDER! Quiet place for a special meal. Privileged space inside the Mandarin Oriental in the middle of Passeig de Gr√†cia. Excellent cuisine by Ra√ºl Balam Ruscalleda. Lovely staff. 100% recommended, we will repeat!\n",
      "Located within the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.This is a 2 Michelin star.We had an elegant meal in a luxurious atmosphere.It doesn‚Äôt taste like firecrackers popping out of your headYou can enjoy your meal without worry.The wine list price isCompared to other karma in BarcelonaNot good.\n",
      "In general lines we liked a lot, but maybe we expected more by having 2 michelin stars and by the references we had of it. Missing details that make you leave a great memory and that desire to repeat (very scarce staff, dark room, visit to kitchen ...). Rich dishes but not all came to impress.\n",
      "A magnificent place where you can taste well-prepared dishes that surprise, not only because of the flavors, but also because of the care with which they are cooked. The extremely friendly and helpful staff also help make the experience even better.If I had to criticize something, it would be that we consider the pairing somewhat expensive for what they offer.Perhaps it is not the Michelin-starred restaurant that I have liked the most, but it is certainly one to consider.\n",
      "Some moments may last for ever. Enjoy an entire evening. And then still be served in Dutch. And the pictures tell more than a hundred words.\n",
      "A Michelin restaurant. The dishes are very good. Worth trying once.\n",

      "-It was like two Michelin stars.I also went to Lotte Tower Stay in Korea, but the class was different.#Good-The staff are very friendly and have good manners.-Goose was on the menu, but he said he couldn't eat it, so he changed it to tuna tadaki.-It has an open kitchen structure, so I could eat while watching the kitchen being cooked.-It was sensible and good that each menu was prepared according to the theme of Opera according to the theme of Opera.-The menu called The Three Tenors was the most delicious, but with various ingredients inside, it felt good to eat like a hamburger.-The last Opera House menu was a great finale made with several chocolates and cookies in the shape of an opera house.-At the end, the main chef came out and said hello and took a picture together.#Bad-Iberico meat came out in Welldone, but it didn't suit my taste. (Barcelona doesn't say specially about roasting meat, it seems to be grilled with Welldone.)-There were many cases where it was difficult to understand the staff's English because it was too fast.#Etc-The meal time was about 3 hours and 30 minutes, so please consider your meal time enough.-In the second half, I couldn't eat everything because I was full.People at other tables also skipped GG at the last main menu.-If you search and know the opera title of each menu in advance and eat food, you will be able to understand the intention of the food more easily and meaningfully.\n",
      "The taste is good, the service is meticulous and the location is convenient.\n",
      "A delicious night A wonderful experience in a pleasant environment. They take care of all the details. Different menus adaptable to vegetarian option. Large cellar Thanks to the whole team for an amazing dinner.\n",
      "Excellent 2-star Michelin experience !!Fantastic restaurant located in the imposing Mandarin Oriental Hotel, one of the best hotels in the city and managed by the prestigious Carme Ruscalleda.The place is hyper elegant, spacious and well lit, with tables and chairs for the occasion, and with crockery and glassware according to the restaurant level.Phenomenal and highly professional service. They are between two and three people looking after you, and presenting each of the dishes perfectly.The menu I tried was an exquisite journey through amazing flavors, textures, and presentations of dishes!I started with an appetizer with cassava and black olive sticks and carqui√±olis, very good.The Marisma is a first course, which is a sole with strawberry, rosemary and salicornia, great !!We continue with a plate of vegetables, each one cooked in a different, interesting style.Then a dish called Desert with lamb, curry and yogurt. Pretty good and original.To continue a sea bass with romesco, beets, cal√ßots and endive that I really liked !!As a meat dish, an Iberian pork feather with black garlic, excellent !!For the pre-dessert turn to cleanse the palate, with an excellent presentation, a biscuit flavored with wasabiFor main dessert, a luxury called \"Greenhouse Effect\" with strawberry, mandarin, celery, perfect from presentation to taste!As if that were not enough with the coffee, the entertainment or petit fours came to everyone better but if I have to stay with one I choose the coffee that was impressive !!An indisputable ‚Äúmust‚Äù of the city to give you a great tribute !!\n",
      "Excellent restaurant with two Michelin stars, led by Chef Ra√ºl Balam Ruscalleda, located in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Passeig de Gracia. Really good kitchen, service and space. Tasting menu \"opera\", with honors, from the first course to the last dessert. Very elaborate dishes, all full of pleasant surprises, truly worthy of their names, that make diners thrill. Liceu, Els tres tenors, Norma, Carmen, Wagner among others, make unforgettable Moments pass. Very highly recommended.\n",
      "Very slow dinner, 4 hours in total, between courses it took forever. Little show of the dishes. From the long menu 4 exquisite dishes, the rest very normal for what was expected. We share the opinion of the 4 people who went. Excessive bill for the experience we expected.\n",
      "It is my partner's favorite place and mine.We have gone 4 times the attention is very good .... the food has good texture, color and is not uncommon for the palate (example: Enigma). It is our magic place üòä\n",
      "Cozy and romantic restaurant in the middle of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwith a very good service and with a tasting menu that takes us through various styles of cuisine from European to Asian through the US and North AfricaThe treatment and the unbeatable facilities, the very professional sommelier.It shows the influence and creativity of the doctor in Ruscalleda kitchen\n",
      "An exceptional place.Don't miss the turbot and the thousand ecosystems that are a lot of taste experiences.The prawn is extraordinary, as is the lake and desert.\n",
      "Very friendly staff, very good service\n",
      "A work of art!\n",
      "Experience the world of the best female chef Carme in Spain. I ate a gourmet tour through Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãstarting with Sanpol de Mar, the most beautiful seaside town in Barcelona. In Sanpol de Mar, the freshness of the ingredients is maximized, especially the fish dishes have a good texture, and the light sauce adds the flavor of the fish. The fusion cuisine of Tokyo and Sanpol de Mar was truly creative. The combination of Japanese tadaki and soy sauce, kale and romasco sauce was the best! In Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãfood was refined and neatly presented as a world-class gourmet city. When you go to Michelin, you may be too embarrassed to experience an experiment, or the display may be out of taste. However, Momentz offers food that will satisfy both those who have never experienced Michelin and those who have experienced it a lot. The taste, the novelty, the creativity and the sophistication are very well balanced. I hope many of you will come here and experience the unforgettable gourmet experiences I have experienced!\n",
      "Amazing restaurant! The wine and food pairing is great. Impeccable service. Tasting menu really too rich, however.\n",
      "Despite eating well from having good service and being in an elegant and well-kept place, I lack identity and surprise to the menu and dinner management. For the price you pay you can eat in more defined places and with identity in Barcelona. The problem with this type of restaurants is that, at least for people with a more economically fair level, they cannot give you opportunities, since when you can make the effort you want to try or new things or places that you already liked.\n",
      "In this case we presented 3 for lunch. Like the other wondrous wondrous. Our waiters made us feel as if we were at home, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa villa was fantastic on their part. And the lunch! What pesols! Rice! The cod in San Polen! Speaking with Raul we commented that there was a point of \"surprise or feeling.\" But his exposition to find the taste, honoring the raw material with simplicity and elegance made us change our minds.So guys! 5 Stars start up again! Thank you for making us feel at home!\n",
      "Tasty gourmet travel!\n",
      "Unfortunately my experience has been very bad. They have taken a long time to take note (understandable if there is a lot of work), but of 10 dishes that are in the menu only 4 were available. The most annoying thing is the preference given to other tables, serving desserts that had been requested in advance (because there were few) to other tables and then having our preferences changed again.\n",
      "In the current haute cuisine trend, with some superlative dishes.\n",
      "I love the food, good atmosphere, many options and it was very difficult to choose. The staff is friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it\n",
      "From the moment you enter you are already enjoying. The menu this season ... Without words! Professional treatment, but close to the diner. Wide range of wines to accompany the tasting\n",
      "Delicious dishes\n",
      "very good food\n",
      "Each plate of appetizers, starters, main courses and desserts was on point. The waiters and waitresses provided a phenomenal service.\n",
      "You must go to life at least one of two Michelin stars that deals with the very good product, the current menu Sant Pol Tokio Barcelona is a collection of the Ruscalleda kitchen with less in addition to an end what is a spectacular bomb!\n",
      "Good attention. Innovative dishes but with a traditional touch. Excellent atmosphere\n",
      "All good how to expect\n",
      "Impressive menu and discreet and very correct attention.\n",

      "Worthy of the stars it owns. The opera-inspired tasting menu is an experience for the senses. Totally recommendable.\n",
      "Brutal. My top in restaurants. A religious experience. We did a tasting menu and after all the pairings we had to go back by taxi (to take this into account üòù)\n",
      "I tried to eat through the app lists and the haha ‚Äã‚Äãcocktail list. Good weather\n",
      "Good place to go to dinner with friends or celebrate birthdays. The food is very good, and lots of it.\n",
      "A wonder from start to finish. I treat the exquisite staff, the tasting menu something really magnificent. We had a great time and look forward to going back. Congratulations to the Mandarin hotel for this gem.\n",
      "ExcellentUnbeatable service. A 10 for the living room equipment.Tasting menu balanced even though one of the dishes does not end up fully tied in the logic of the gastronomic journey.Recomendable at 100‚ÑÖ.\n",
      "Very good experience. Excellent service Dishes that look like paintings. Chef Ra√∫l Balam goes through the tables at the end of the service to see what you think of it.\n",
      "Excellent, the food and the presentation of all the dishes elaborated to the smallest detail impeccable serviceOne of the best restaurants in Barcelona where I've eaten üòÄ\n",

      "Beautiful views and nice food\n",
      "Amazing evening with my husband. Kitchen for all the senses.\n",
      "It feels like 2 to 3 hours of meal time passing by in a blink of an eye! The course menu becomes more and more splendid with the end of the dish,\n",
      "The menu is risky and original. There are very good dishes and others not so much. I expected more from the desserts. I do not see correlation with the price. I have enjoyed more in other Michelin of lower category.\n",
      "We tried the tasting menu of 13 dishes. There were some extraordinary (Velvet, lacquered Turbot, Tataki, Asparagus, Sweet Bomba Barceloneta) and others less (Cod to the Santpolenca excessively salty) The attention by the room staff was correct and the surroundings pleasant. I think the price is not related to the menu: it is excessively expensive. We have tried another Michelin restaurant in Barcelona with lower category and surpassed it in relation to quality price\n",
      "I left disappointed. It is fine in all aspects: local, service and food. The problem is that no dish came to fall in love and that is not good for a restaurant with these characteristics. I am sorry to say it, but I will not repeat.\n",

      "Incredible dining experience, highly recommended\n",
      "Iberian pigs are roasted just right, and the aftertaste is endless. But other dishes are quite satisfactory, especially when using coffee to make sauces with seafood is a new height.\n",
      "Place to go if you are a lover of good cuisine. Everything was great and the staff very attentive. We spent almost 3 hours with the tasting menu and time flew by.To be thankful that Chef Ra√ºl Balam came out to see how everything had gone.\n",
      "Great food and lunch menu with very good value for money\n",
      "The place good, the service unbeatable, the food was good, we made the December tasting menu that they advise, the frequency of correct dishes, but I was not impressed as much as other places.\n",
      "I am sorry to say that we did not have a good experience at all, I do not usually review negative aspects but in this case I do so because it is a pity that due to a bad attitude on the part of a team member it has not become such a \"moment\" special we wanted.The case is that we were last May 12, 2018 eating my wife and I to celebrate our anniversary.Everything was great (reception, accompaniment while we ate, we even photographed ourselves with Ra√ºl Balam, etc ...) but the sommelier was not up to the task, she did not connect with us, we asked for advice regarding the pairing and she gave us to understand that it was a choice ours in a dry and little empathetic way. As a result, we chose a good Cava Recaredo reserva 2005 that we saw how they left it out in the open for 10 minutes and I made a comment on whether it would be cold enough to which it replied again as if it were offended by said comment. In short, we were quite surprised and even seemed to be reciprocal because he never came back to our table.I also understand that we are people and a bad day can be had by anyone but we were disappointed in that aspect and we left that bad aftertaste.\n",
      "The food is full of flavor and the location is excellent. This is the best restaurant I have ever had.\n",
      "I ate for three hours. The presentation was interesting and good as well as the taste ~\n",
      "First of all, it should be noted that the general treatment of the waiters and all the room staff was excellent, so they would be 5 stars in that regard. What we found a bit disappointing were the dishes if we consider the price and the fact that we are in a two Michelin star hotel, where, not only do you want to eat well but also to be surprised with different things and intense flavors and the truth that, except a couple of dishes, it was not. The presentation is spectacular but the dishes themselves are bland with little personality. It was a bit sad to find that when you are paying good money, what is not understood is how it can be that it has two Michelin stars.\n",
      "Incredible dining experience, highly recommended, thank you very much to the whole team\n",
      "Excellent card.\n",
      "Definitely very rich. The taste .... The quality .... The attention .... I will return. Life deserves more moments like this. Although this moment is unique.\n",

      "Neighborhood bar of the lifelong.Place of visit: Bar Nou (Rambla Prim)Date of visit: 11/25/2016This is the typical bar that we vulgarly say that \"takes all the life\" in the neighborhood.Local \"old\", with furniture a little \"outdated\", with a large bar entering on the right and a small dining room on the left with a large television.The place is so many years old that the \"tickets\" machine does not work, and if you need one, they make them by hand.They also have a small terrace outside.They have all kinds of sandwiches and at very good prices.At midday they offer a menu for 9.50 euros that includes a first, a second, bread, drink, dessert and coffee.For the dishes that appear in the menu it is clear that they are \"homemade\", as they themselves advertise on a blackboard that is before entering the premises.I was having a mini tuna sandwich breakfast, which was very full of tuna and quite good, with a coffee with milk for 2.50 euros.A very good price.The boy who attends is attentive and quick to serve.\n",

Their lunchtime menus for the currelas taste just like the snacks your grandmother prepared for recess, they are full of the same love. Only here could you cook the best potato omelette in all of Barcelona. If you are lucky enough to try it you will not be able to stop telling it to the first one who pays attention to you.

      "I went there for dinner with some friends because they had once recommended it to me. The average price we have left per head has been ‚Ç¨ 18 having taken a salad and a starter to share and each a dish, not counting the dessert. The fact is that I was disappointed, the starters without further ado, the crispy pizzas (in general the portions seemed small to us) but to say that the combinations of ingredients were well thought out. The third friend grabbed a macaroni that looked very good with meatballs and truffles, but what came to the table had nothing to do with it. The macaroni had almost no sauce and were a bit dry. So, bottom line is that I'm really looking forward to it. Positive aspects, however, is the service, very friendly and attentive also the decoration of the space is funny.P.D.The photos are the dishes having already started eating because we were starving.\n",
      "Good atmosphere and quality products. Perfect for dining with friends or as a couple. I highlight the excellent service of the waiters. I will certainly repeat when I return to Barcelona. !! Congratulations!!\n",
      "The best Italian restaurant in Barcelona. You definitely have to go! I highly recommend the truffle pizzette and the gnoccis. In addition, the service is very nice and the place is super nice!\n",
      "good service and waiters! I don't like the gnocchi very much, but the squid with the sauce- delicious\n",
      "Ideal restaurant for lunch or dinner. Good atmosphere and varied menu!\n",
      "Delicious food in the center of Barcelona. Vitello silly of death and the brutal mortadella. The pizzas are also super delicious!\n",
      "Nice place with excellent food.Let Marco advise you.The sardines a la saor essential!Do not miss it!\n",
      "Since they opened I have been there several times and it is always a hit. Whether for a lunch or dinner with friends, family or with a partner it is a nice place where treatment and food always meet expectations.My favorite snacks are 'Robiola & mortadella' and 'stracciatella & pesto'.The pizzas are all very good and if you love truffles I recommend Truffle, taleggio and egg. I also really like the burrata.\n",
      "The attention of the waiter Marco excellent, the fantastic Sardegna wine and the exquisite food. If I have something to say ... it is that there is little variety on the menu and the dishes are not very big ... but I will return and recommend it 100%.\n",
      "Authentic Italian cuisine (Venetian tavern) and out of the most common dishes. The service always makes you feel welcome\n",
      "I had it on my list for a while and we finally went. Very good decoration, atmosphere and attention. Delicious food, you can tell that everything is made with quality ingredients. We found everything delicious, the menu is a bit short but it is worth what they offer. We will repeat for sure! A great Italian restaurant in Barcelona.\n",
      "Great, not only the treat but the food is noticeable fresh. We'll be coming back!\n",
      "I have gone with a celiac, a vegetarian and a pregnant woman with dietary limitations, and everything has been facilitated. We have proposed options without gluten and vegetarians. And we also ate super well and we felt very well attended. Very good Italian craft beer that they have √† la carte. The price is correct and the place is quite nice, with space between tables. They have one reserved for groups.\n",
      "Excellent! A menu with few things but all very good (I do not have many dishes to taste). The truffle, taleggio and egg yolk pizzette is spectacular but the agnolotti are my favorite dish. Don't miss the opportunity to go there!\n",
      "Very attentive and pleasant staff and the pizzas are all very tasty. Better on the terrace, as not many cars pass by on the street and so you are outdoors.\n",
      "Ideal place excellent and very friendly foods ... wide choice price ok\n",
      "I was with my partner 3 Sundays ago. I had it as one of my top in Barcelona. I had not been there since the pandemic, and I was very excited and eager for me to try one of my favorite restaurants.But the truth is that I was disappointed. The service very well. But I don't know if they have changed the chef, but to begin with there was no sea bass tartar. The waiter recommended Harry's tartare, and it tasted pretty lousy.We wanted to save the night by trying a truffle rigatoni (truffle there was nothing at all) and then the vegetable risotto and it was salty, exaggerated chunks of beans ...Regarding the wine, I remembered that they had a very refined Merlot. But now the taste and flavor was different. Wine is based on taste, but I was disappointed.Anyway. I'll give you a second chance but later. But this time the dinner tasted really bad, really.I hope it was not because it was Sunday and it was not very fresh product or the latest ...\n",
      "The food was tasty, the service however, was not the best! Good atmosphere in the restaurant, the terrace is fine!\n",
      "Excellent service, delicious food and authentic Italian. Unbeatable.\n",
      "The plate has arrived, after waiting a long time, and the pasta had a hair embedded in the meatball.We were hoping that the restaurant would invite us to lunch, which is normal after a serious mistake like this and so unpleasant but No.They have charged us for the drinks and the other dish. Very disappointing\n",
      "Quite correct / good pasta, nice and central place. They don't take care of the details. Price according to what they offer.\n",
      "A small but extremely careful menu. The delicious pizzas, the pasta, perfect. And the friendly and efficient treatment! You can tell that they take care of the details, both in food and in the presentation and decoration. A lovely place to which I plan to return!\n",
      "A discovery for us this place to dine delicious and feel for a moment in beautiful Italy. Exceptional food and service! We will be back! I recommend sharing and tasting everything a little.\n",
      "Good food in a very cool place (the entrance is from a bar but the interior is a very well decorated restaurant). I recommend straciatella, steak tartar (ask for little spicy) truffle pizzetta. Tiramisu is a must! Good distance between tables and full service with masks.\n",
      "Great service and great food, I love it\n",
      "Super good ! I recommend\n",
      "You can see that the product is of good quality. The dishes are not very strong but they are delicious.\n",

      "At night, we walked around the city. Suddenly we looked and we noticed the light and warmth of the place, so we could not resist us in. Surprise! Is an Italian restaurant. Let's try!!. The steak tartare is delicious and rich spicy sausage pizza rich. The quiet atmosphere and the treatment of the service very friendly and helpful, offering suggestions to the letter. A place to come and experience we have left a lot to prove. We will be back. We recommend it. üëç\n",
      "Italian restaurant with excellent treatment by all the workers, including part of the kitchen. Close smiling and concerned about the well-being and comfort of the guests. The food is very good and with a very competitive price for the area in which it is located and how cozy the place is. We will repeat for sure!\n",
      "In general, it is a very attractive proposal, at an unbeatable price and with a careful decoration for the price range in which it operates. Everything is designed to share and in general all the dishes are delicious (let's not expect the best Italian in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãfar from it), especially the steak tartare and the pizzas (we asked them to make them a little more than usual). 100% Italian wine list which makes it fun. Uninterrupted hours from 11am to 11pm. It is a good wildcard for the typical Sunday that you fancy Italian without too many complications and at an affordable price\n",
      "Very good deal, I really like to find old school hotels than with the. That is falling still smile!I heartily recommend it!\n",
      "Customer service with a lot of professionalism.\n",
      "Fantastic! It has become one of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona. Besides being great, they are super attentive and friendly. In addition, the space is very cozy. The food and service are excellent. We will be back and of course we recommend it!\n",
      "A place I accidentally discovered and entered.The alcohol is so delicious that I keep ordering itThe two drank six cups ^^The atmosphere is so good, I'm really overseasIt feels good, and the staff are all friendly^^!\n",
      "Starter to share, sublime, the coppa too too tasty, then exceptional pizza, the dessert let's not talk about the best of the best\n",
      "You eat well, a lot of cheese in everything. The place is very nice, but a cook comes out wearing a mask that is disrespectful to the diners who weren't Taliban.\n",
      "Not recommendedWe ordered a spinach salad and they surprised us with 4 leaves of bagged sprouts a piece of gorgonzola and 2 walnuts without any grace and 8 euros. Painful not to repeat\n",

I don't know which one to stay with ... the truth ... but the Robiola & Mortadella and Stracciatella are delicious.The Sobrasada pizzeta \"Cal Rovira\" is very good, the Rigatoni, meatballs and impressive truffle.Two amazing dishes ... Steak tartare, Cipriani and Vitello tonnato.If you are a group (6/7 people) you will surely love the Baccaro table.On Thursdays they do Italian aperitif.\n",

      "Just great.The first quality food, and the spectacular attention\n",
      "Restaurant with very good service and great quality of food on offer. It is a restaurant with northern Italian cuisine, it is not a pizzeria or trattoria.

      "Hun / EngIt is a very friendly place, for football lovers it can even be a museum, as the walls preserve a 27-year-old collection. A wide range of drinks, there is plenty of Hungarian but also Spanish and Catalan food. The pub is small, it fills up quickly during matches, but the match is broadcast. The portions are a flurry, so for the money you won‚Äôt starve. For Hungarians with special kindness (with brandy, beer chocolate cubes, tapas).Very friendly, and a small museum for a soccer / football lover. They have been collecting relics for 27 years. They have a lot of hungarian dishes, and also spanish, catalan. It can be croweded easily, it is a small place. The portions are copious.\n",

      "Restaurant very atypical. If you do not like the football or team sport in general do not go there. Otherwise you will love the decor and the welcome. Before match or after you can eat homemade dishes. Nothing very refined but just homemade.\n",
      "From outside we wonder where we fell? But the interior is like an ali baba cave. A decoration very focused on the football and the sport, a rather simple but good kitchen. I recommend this place especially for decor and drinks.\n",
      "Excellent, friendly service, fine food, divine beers.\n",
      "This restaurant - which is close to Camp Nou - is definitely a must-go, because only the Hungarian staff are very kind and friendly. The restaurant is very unique inside. The dishes are made according to divine, original Spanish recipes, but the portions are \"Hungarian\". You are guaranteed to eat if you eat here. Not to be missed. I recommend seafood bowl !!!\n",

      "Only positive! Whether the guest is Hungarian or foreign, they are very kind and helpful to everyone! I recommend their own beer to everyone, very drunk!

      "We ate, the beef was good :) and there is Hungarian in it :) I highly recommend it\n",
      "Kind helpful staff who always try their best to fulfill the wishes of the guests. The best example of this is when the owner lady called back and forth at midnight because some of her Hungarian compatriots did not book accommodation for the night after the Bar√ßa match.\n",
      "Only 5 *. It is in a great location close to Camp Nou. Dear staff fast service. L‚ÄôHospitalet and the Arc de Triomf can be reached on foot in 1 hour.It is also obligatory if our compatriots have already \"settled\" here with great difficulty and are really happy to welcome us. In terms of value for money, I would really say it is expensive, but please live, once we live, let‚Äôs try everything!Thank you for your hospitality!\n",

      "Worth checking out. Delicious food, family atmosphere, great service.\n",
      "You have to take it not as a restaurant or a place where you are going to eat, but as a place where you are going to live a culinary experience like few others.In our case, it was a 3-hour long and intense menu, but one that is enjoyed until the last portion of the dish.Regarding the price, I did not find it expensive for what is offered. The attention was very cordial at all times and we were able to reserve a table just a few hours in advance, which is appreciated.I leave a few pictures, which are worth more than 1000 words.\n",
      "An unforgettable experience, we took the long menu, which has well measured quantities and each dish was original, aesthetically beautiful and with spectacular flavors and textures. Our favorites: the squid, the mullet and the flower dessert. They have given it the second star recently, totally deserved, and at the moment the price is very competitive. The sommelier was also very successful in recommending the wine. Attentive service and very pleasant atmosphere. Fun surprise on XD services\n",
      "Today we can enjoy this pending gift from the Magi. After a covid-19 that made us lose, for a while, taste and smell. A pleasure to enjoy the #cincsentits. Mediterranean cuisine with avant-garde techniques but without losing the essence of the raw material and the local product.Today we can enjoy this pending gift from the Magi.

      "First experience in a restaurant of this nature and we can not be happier with the treatment, quality and menu idea. I recommend the 100% experience\n",
      "Spectacular!!! Well, no, the following. 2 deserved michelin stars. And private meeting with the chef. Unforgetable experience\n",
      "A surprising and pleasant surprise hidden in Barcelona.Perfect service and a Catalan gastronomic experience from start to finish. Elegance in every detail and accompaniment at all times.Two options, depending on the season, tasting menu (difference in number of dishes) and wine pairing.A jewel in its five senses highly recommended.\n",
      "Excellent service, very friendly and attentive waiters.Very well prepared dishes, a nice great experience\n",
      "After trying quite a few award-winning restaurants, we went to this one with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãadding one more to the list, our surprise was pleasing when from the very entrance the service, attention to the diner was top, but even more so, as the evening passed you realized That this treatment is not accidental, it is very worked, they strive to make the evening very pleasant, pending the diner leaving their space without addressing the privacy of the customers, something fantastic. What can be said about food, I have no adjectives, simply an Ode to food, to preparation, careful presentations and flavors. Also very affordable price for that level of restaurant\n",
      "Great experience!! The spectacular food and the unbeatable treatment.Highly recommended\n",
      "One of the hardest reviews to write: the restaurant has a wonderful and accomplished track record; however, the new location is very cold. They are absolutely strict with the issue of hygiene measures for the virus ... to the point of almost uncomfortable. The staff are friendly, attentive and at the same time tense and too \"stuffy\"; They do not allow themselves to smile, adjust the rhythm and give a touch of lightness. My partner has been several times, for me it was the first time and the truth is I was very disappointed. The product is good and the preparation is good, however, I do not think I will return.\n",
      "Fantastic gastronomic experience. I recommend the tasting menu with pairing, we were two and with a pairing we were fine. I have to say that we loved it. From the moment you walk through the door and they transport you with its decoration and its history through the family's fields, vineyards and olive trees ... Excellent treatment. Highly recommended\n",
      "Exquisite treatment, anti-covid measures from the first minute and a menu at the 2-star level. To highlight the squid, the starters and especially the desserts. We have forgotten the world for 3 hours\n",
      "Spectacular staging. High quality menu and wide range of tastes. Very rich. Highly recommended\n",
      "Two deserved Michelin stars. Magnificent in every way, room service, sommelier and kitchen. The presentation of the dishes is a visual delight and the perfect rhythm.We highlight two sober dishes:The squid in soft strips with ol√≠ de picada, squid sauce onions, red chilli and crunchy ink is second to none.The pork tenderloin with garlic crumbs, grilled ribs, sour apple, padr√≥n pepper, celery and turnip mousse, pickled apple and a trompe l'oeil that we don't reveal so as not to spoil the surprise, is a perfect blend of flavors. Unforgettable already.The wine, Clos d'Agon Blanc 2015, matched perfectly. Great wine.As it was dinner, we opted for the short menu. With wine, two people, ‚Ç¨ 290.\n",
      "Awesome. Possibly one of the best \"Michelin\" dining experiences I have ever had. All the dishes on the long menu are super good, wine pairing very appropriate to the dishes, very good service. My partner is pregnant and they have adjusted everything necessary to make us feel comfortable. I totally recommend the experience\n",
      "Sublime experience. A star that leaves you wanting to return. Exquisite treatment by the workers. Experience that makes you immerse yourself since you take the first step inside the premises\n",
      "Much attention to detail. The menu tells the chef's history and experiences through the senses. Nice trip. Essential foie and sweet wine\n",
      "A very good experience\n",
      "Wonderful experience\n",
      "The food is very rich and elaborate. Very fair amounts. Good attention.\n",
      "The presentation was wonderful and the staff service was meticulous. The food was also wonderful, shaking the five senses.\n",
      "A pleasure, as it is called ... the 5 senses in their purest form. Innovative, sensational, a huge experience!\n",
      "Very cozy place and sensational menu. She is deserving of the Michelin star. Congratulations !!!\n",
      "A unique experience. The cuisine is creative, but without forgetting the importance of the raw material. Far superior to other Michelin star restaurants\n",
      "The incredible food, it is a unique gastronomic experience, we did a tasting menu with wine pairing. The downside is that the pairing bothered us a bit at dinner, wines that wanted to gain too much prominence by overshadowing the food, and the odd mistake such as a sweet txacol√≠ for a foie that already had the chef's sweet touch, I recommend 100% the Tasting menu but not its pairing. We will return choosing the wine ourselves\n",
      "A spectacular experience, highly recommended ... A mixture of tradition and avant-garde .. I have chosen the tasting menu, there were ten dishes each with its special touch, the dish that has made me fall in love is the viera with the Jerusalem artichoke puree, simply a bomb flavor in the mouth .. You can see from the entrance to the restaurant the love that the chef has for his people and with the exquisite food he transmits everything .. Both the attention and the very well cared for health standards .. !! A 10 because you can't do it anymore üòãüëèüèº\n",
      "Very very very rich.We liked the detail at the exit to continue enjoying. The dishes are presented at the expected level. The only thing missing are views to the outside.\n",
      "Brutalllll experience, not the petit month but !!!!!\n",
      "Restaurant with a Michelin Star. I tried the short tasting menu. A small vermouth and mini tapas, pretty good. Appetizers, very good. Mushrooms, excellent. Trout, spectacular. Loin, excellent. Dessert, very good. Main dessert, spectacular. Chupito to finalize and gift bag, with the menu and tube with gusto to biscuit Mar√≠a and colacao. Since you walk in the door, you are explaining the origin of the family, and try to reflect it in the menu. Flavors and textures very achieved. Trying to differentiate yourself from others (little signs with the name and explanation of the dishes ...). The treatment of the staff is excellent, pleasant and helpful. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I went to celebrate my 30th anniversary with the family. We liked it, although we weren't fascinated either. The place is impeccable, very beautiful. Very attentive service. Good food, but we expected better. I would have put 4 stars if it weren't for a couple of details. I found it very shabby that they didn't serve me the dessert on the menu which they served to my whole family, because they put a ball of cheesecake with a candle on me. If you want to make a detail that is fine, but do not substitute the dessert on the menu, so you understand it as a detail for the diner. They had to let me try theirs. A dessert on the menu is always more elaborate and more thought out, which is why we go to this type of restaurant. The other detail is the substitution they made for one of the dishes. I don't eat meat and I had to watch how others ate a plate while I had nothing on the table. I had to wait for the second part of the others' plate, so that they would make mine for me. They are details that are difficult to understand in a restaurant like this ... It tastes bad, but I would not return.\n",
      "Phew! I will repeat! Everything spectacular, from the moment you walk through the door until they give you the bag with the summary of your experience.\n",
      "Very cozy excellent food and very good treatment from the employees I will definitely return\n",
      "Tasting menu of creative Catalan cuisine inspired by the history of the chef's family, of quality with imagination that makes you enjoy with all your senses. Nice place, there are private rooms and rooms. Professional, polite and respectful service.You have to book in advance.Two well-deserved Michelin stars.If you like cava, ask for the Argent de Gramona that they bottled especially for an anniversary, I particularly love it, I consider it between a cava and a champagne, I am not a specialist, but its finer bubbles and its flavor make it a little I drink alcohol, and I hardly ever drink anything with gas or alcohol.Do not miss it, you will enjoy it, the price is reasonable and you will be delighted and even with the snack (see photos)\n",
      "Spectacular service and value for money very good\n",
      "A very good experience.\n",
      "Excellent tasting menu!\n",
      "The dishes are very neutral in taste. Raw asparagus, we didn't like it, a deer roll, either, and so on one after another. Until the desserts have positively surprised you. We will not be back.\n",
      "Overpriced, too much hype. All correct but nothing to rave about.\n",
      "Great menu. Product and technique. Excellent service. Improved pairing\n",
      "If you want to treat yourself and you like to eat delicious, this is your place. It is a great experience, and more if you share it with someone.\n",
      "This site is worth it. Avant-garde cuisine but very very rich and with good ingredients.Also, the dishes are very well thought out, no nonsensical paraphernalia. Molt bo\n",
      "Fresh products, very well prepared and an attention of 10. It truly sharpens the senses. The place is highly recommended.\n",
      "Spectacular from start to finish. They are in all the details. I really liked the welcome with its explanations and the treatment in general. Delicious food, not cheap, but worth a treat. In our case we chose the menu with pairings and I consider that it should be done with it because you live it as a more complete experience\n",
      "Two well-deserved stars\n",
      "Amazing experience !!! 2 very deserved michelin stars !!! They offer a spectacular tasting menu. Enjoy !!!\n",
      "Unforgettable experience, we will return\n",
      "Good restaurant with very good tasting menu, everything was exquisite. We ordered the short menu and we who don't eat much were fine and we would have eaten the longest.The treatment of the staff was very good, although several times I had to wait for more wine to be served, normally in this type of restaurant you don't have time to wait as they are already attentive to fill it up. Otherwise great.\n",
      "Impressive service, innovation, presentation, quality.\n",
      "It does not have a terrace. It admits reservations. The menu of the day for ‚Ç¨ 13 !! With water + drink, bread, dessert and coffee !! Cooking school change the menu every two weeks. The best the attention of the waiters and the plating !! The brutally rich food. The bad thing that they only have San Miguel beer\n",
      "Great lunch menu that interprets great dishes of contemporary cuisine at a very reasonable price, ‚Ç¨ 24.The students take care of the details, the attention is exquisite and the dishes are delicious.An incredible value for money and a place to surprise and be amazed.\n",
      "ESHOB students offer an interpretation of Michelin-star chef dishes at daily menu prices. Spectacular. The future of restoration is in good hands.\n",
      "Very good dinnerAnd very good service, great cuisine\n",
      "The customer service is, without a doubt, its best quality. In my case, the menu I had for dinner was pretty good overall, good quality price. To highlight the dessert, the apple pie was great.\n",
      "A special place, helping students to recognize their progress, good 10's food and good price. You have to go every month. congratulations\n",
      "Fantastic menu of ‚Ç¨ 24 with a great service in a very cozy place overlooking Taulat. The only catch was the wait, more than two hours to eat. The rest, great!\n",
      "Cooking school where students are responsible for the attention and food. The treatment was excellent from the first moment and the service quite good. The food of great quality (the best Angus I have eaten so far), the kitchen very good and the abundant amount per dish. (Daily menu ‚Ç¨ - ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ / Special menu $$ - ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨) Recommended.\n",
      "Let's judge the philosophy of the restaurant. It is about young people learning a profession with all that it entails. At all times we feel well cared for and with the feeling of being in a good restaurant. Seeing the attitude with which they serve you, it is easy to empathize with them and you end up ignoring any mistake.As for fair value food. Our experience went from more to less. We liked the first ones a lot, the second ones were correct but they punctured the dessert. The dessert seemed simple and little thought compared to the rest. A fruit salad with nothing (an English cream or chocolate) and a buggy chocolate mousse.In short, I would repeat without hesitation. In fact, I want to do it to give desserts another chance.\n",
      "Excellent food, variety of dishes, good service. Economical price\n",
      "Good menu at a very good price.And to finish the meal a delicious dessert and a house specialty coffee.A great staff treat. At the end of the meal, the chef went out to ask about the dishes on the menu\n",
      "School with good food at a good price (menu 24 ‚Ç¨). It is advised to book and go with time.\n",
      "Quality, good level and effort to train future good professionals. Excellent!\n",
      "Read the menu - marvel: how many famous names and what interesting combinations of tastes. The place is famous for the fact that it does not cost too much - 22 euros for a business lunch, and at the same time, service and food are like in the first-class restaurants. In fact, the service is quite slow, and if you take into account the queue that accumulates at the entrance to lunch time, this place is suitable for lunch only on those days when you are in no hurry at all. They feed well, the presentation is beautiful, the place is very nice, and from this year there is a summer terrace, the most comfortable, under the wall, entwined with colorful ivy. Now a lot of interesting things appear on the business lunch menu, including something with jamon juice! This is an occasion to boast of exotic experiences.\n",
      "Excellent option to eat well at a great price. Better to book\n",
      "Very good level and variety of dishes. The food, presentation included, excellent, and at an economical price.Speed ‚Äã‚Äãand attention\n",
      "One of the favorite restaurants in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãexcellent quality / price ratio. Very elaborate and rich dishes. We always go for dinner calmly upstairs.Better to book in advance, especially if you are going with a group. They have a menu for ‚Ç¨ 22 which is super good. A welcome cocktail, a snack, a first to choose and a second, plus dessert. Coffees and drinks go apart.A very original first: Catalan cream of foie.We had a great time ! Many thanks to all the staff!\n",
      "They have, on the top floor, a spectacular menu at a very good value for money. The very correct service. Too bad it's not located in a more central location.\n",
      "Nice and quiet place. On the lower floor you can eat from the menu and without reservation. On the upper floor, the decoration is more elegant, with tables for groups and private areas. They have a menu of dishes prepared by eshob students who briefly introduce the dishes. The quality is good in general, somewhat salty dishes if you use to eat with little salt and more quantity is missing in some dish. Pretty poor desserts\n",
      "We went for dinner during the week and the relation price very good.\n",
      "I really like this site. They have a weekly menu with many options. All delicious and excellent service.\n",
      "Very good restaurant - academy where the students of the school provide their kitchen and service services. The quality of the dishes, being a learning and experimental center, is above the price. It is worth coming, helping the center, seeing how you learn, at the cost of an offer with a lot of quality and flavor. Highly recommended.\n",
      "The delicious food is the same as always but with different touches. The service worthy of a restaurant of the highest level, being students of the school take great care of every detail, whenever I went I felt super comfortable. The place is cozy and very nice. The truth is for the price of the lunch menu on weekdays (13 ‚Ç¨) you get more than you pay, any other place here next door would charge you twice as much for the food and service.\n",
      "Daily menu on the ground floor, high quality at ‚Ç¨ 13. The schedule is until 15:00 and is not reserved.\n",
      "Dishes very well presented by apprentices of hospitality and delicious!\n",

      "Good food and good service\n",
      "Very good experience. The students are very caring. The taste of the food depends on the students. There are a few dishes that are amazing and some are...This is a place that will give you a new feeling every time. 100% recommended!\n",
      "Normal place, regular service (keep in mind they are students and still afraid to serve a glass of water) regular food\n",
      "Ata kitchen at a good price, the chic @ s very nice\n",
      "The best bcn restaurant!\n",
      "It is certainly an interesting experiment: the students of the Barcelona hotel school work for the public every night.Some dishes are a little less good, but most are often extraordinary.The price is always very cheap.If our hotel schools did the same DAILY they would come out with broken bones.Who knows when we will take an example you know .... best examples !!!!!!\n",
      "Very good menu on the ground floor. 3 first 3 seconds and several desserts. Very nice staff Cheap and quality. I'm left with the desire to repeat and try the menu on the second floor. Good attention and good cooking.\n",
      "We went for dinner. The quality of the dishes was EXCELLENT, both the first (sweet rice, warm salad with mushrooms and salmorejo), and the second (low temperature cod and Iberian secret). Really very good everything. The presentation is very careful and the portions are pretty good.Negative point: the waiting time to bring us the first dish, and then between dishes. We were easily waiting 25 minutes between dishes.On the other hand, the service in general is very good (they are students and you notice that they are motivated). In our case, they brought us a dish we had not ordered. The waitress, instead of apologizing and offering to change the plate, said she had it pointed that way.Value for money: interesting.\n",
      "Good food and a very correct treatment, it is worth remembering that they are hotel school students and that just a month ago the course started\n",
      "Great, I loved it.The service and attention are magnificent.The dishes very well prepared and the price excellent.\n",

      "Delicious\n",
      "It is a different place, boys and girls strive to be as professional as possible. The food is very good, all homemade and good price. I recommend it!\n",

      "There is no restaurant in all of Barcelona and probably in all of Catalonia that will serve you a daily menu of such good quality for the price they ask.The service is very good, as the boys and girls who take care of you, the students, do it fantastically.if you haven't gone to lunch or dinner yet It's too late. I recommend it 100% üòä\n",

      "Place with two dining rooms for different budgets. Young and pleasant staff. Food made by cooking students, good. They ask at the end for the satisfaction of the dishes.\n",
      "Catering school where you can taste haute cuisine at reasonable prices. Nice atmosphere and place, excellent cuisine. I was a little annoyed that the waiters (apprentices) were planted there waiting for you to need something, but it comes to be common in some restaurants like this.\n",
      "You can eat reasonably well at a reasonable price. While there are times that you notice that the kids are learning, but it's normal, it's a school. And they always have a good disposition.\n",
      "We ate very well, very well prepared meals. The fast service and good work of the students. Come in.\n",
      "They are students and yet I think they do very well. The criticism is for the trainers in the room, who are correcting the waiters and apart from the fact that they should do it without the customers seeing it, they do it in bad ways, with bad character.\n",
      "It is not because he is a former student, it is that the quality is great, I occasionally go with a friend and / or family, really acceptable price is already a more ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù style of food, you do not usually go hungry.\n",
      "Spectacular cooking and attention of the students of the hospitality school. Amazing price for quality\n",
      "Very good food, quality raw material, careful cooking and close to sophistication, good treatment and very economical price.\n",

I have to admit that it was a nice experience to be able to see at the same table how some of the dishes are made, the presentation of them and the dedication and enthusiasm with which the guys give themselves to their work.

      "In recent years the company has insisted on going to this place for Christmas food. I have already tried two different menus than what they offer and I find them mediocre and lacking in grace. Much design and new cuisine to present rare and poor dishes. Now, the best thing is the dessert, this time a mango ice cream nut with a Nocilla Christmas tree drawn on the plate and a piece of dried chocolate sponge cake. To forget. A lot of school, but little knowledge and much less category. How the company pays, we will continue to go where they take us\n",

      "I went a couple of times and really eat very well I ordered a plate of chicken skewers and it was great the price quality ratio seemed good, what if I have to say is that the site is a bit narrow and if you go in a group (We were about 20 people) they organized everything so that you could all sit down, the waitress was very attentive and I liked the deal very much, the.

This time they don't even tell us and we do 60km so that it says on its face that it has everything full (there was only one table) and I doubt that more people will go with the filthy glass that they have outside ... and they say they have canceled the reservation ...in this place it seems to me that they do not like LGTB couples who are going to spend their money .. they must have money left over ...The reservation has always been made two days in advance. Homophobia? Probably because of the joke he released when he left‚Ä¶ reportable! I will surely take legal action.\n",

All the dishes were very good and very well prepared. The foie micuit that they make is very generous and delicious, the truffle ravioli very tasty and what to say about the sirloin ... it fell apart and was also very generous. The confit cod also fell apart. For dessert we have ordered some of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted. The wine list is very complete in both white and red, which are the ones I know the most and of all prices. In short, we will repeat for sure and invite more people to go. We will also take clients of our companies because it is a sure guarantee of success ... good food, spacious tables and excellent service.The best thing is to go to the places without any great expectations and that way you enjoy them more.\n",

      "They had always told me about this place, days ago I went and it really is extremely cheap and accessible to anyone, the tapas are tasty and the beer too ... the only thing thatIt seems wrong is that the letter says that the cane is worth ‚Ç¨ 0.90 or ‚Ç¨ 1 and they always end up charging you ‚Ç¨ 1.50, which I find very misleading (I did not say anything because it is still cheap) but be careful with this ... and another negative thing is that every time you ask you have to pay at once, being able to create an account per table, right? It's the only bad thing. Rest very good.\n",

Each element does its part to give a truly unique food and wine experience.There are few restaurants where every element is in the right place, De Angelis is one of them. From the aperitif to the coffee, everything is truly excellent!If you are in Barcelona you absolutely cannot miss this beautiful and passionate piece of Italy\n",

      "Italian restaurant with homemade food. No half-day menu, but you could eat for a value of ‚Ç¨ 12 to ‚Ç¨ 15 per person. A pleasant surprise from Angelis.De Angelis is the example that you can have an Italian restaurant without charging for the air you breathe. Let me explain: the appetizer of the canes is not charged. There are no terrace supplements. Invitation to a quality shot. The price paid for the PIECE tiramisu is a gift.The exquisite pasta. The octopus (and we're talking about an Italian restaurant) is very good.The only flaw. For my taste The sausage of the pitzza (ortholana) with the same quantity but to be able to be chopped.Attentive and polite staff.\n",

The attention is very friendly. And the tiramisu very rich! The price is fair to the quality!Edit: On a second visit we have tried the mushroom risotto, and it was very tasty too.Another point is that the menu contains only Italian wines.\n",
      "100% Italian cuisine. Busy place in the middle of Riera Blanca. Very good product quality. I recommend the pasta al fruti di mare, cooked just right, as well as the pistachio tiramisu. Very attentive and fast service. They invited us to a few shots of Italian limonchello and staple. Very correct price. We will be back for sure!\n",
      "Excellent Italian restaurant to eat. Extensive menu with all kinds of Italian dishes (starters, pasta, pizza, salads, meat, desserts ...). We have come on several occasions and everything is of quality ... great. Today we each ordered a plate of pasta and a pizza to share and all very good, it hurts her that the creamy cheesecake this time was not so creamy but it was still delicious. Attention from 10 employees as on other occasions.\n",
      "Restaurant with a different restaurant concept, where the tech concept is explored in every way.We live in an age hyperconnected to our mobile and electronic devices, but paradoxically this environment helps us interact with each other more than it may seem leaving our terminals aside.The tables are large interactive screens where you can play, share and connect with other diners. Perhaps the most innovative concept is that the \"head waiter\", \"meter\" and \"waiter\" disappear, here the way to communicate with the restaurant is also this. At all times you choose, order and order the dishes and drinks through the interactive table, which they have to adjust, as on several occasions we received the drinks late and untimely. It‚Äôs a change of concept, and knowing that orders go directly to the kitchen it‚Äôs surprising that it doesn‚Äôt improve in efficiency. Human contact with the service is lost a bit.When it comes to food, the dishes are priced according to the area and technological experience. The portions are strong enough and quality. The drinks are priced a bit high, but the NUA beer tastes great and the mojitos and cocktails are fine as well.Overall a positive experience with some points for improvement, but that shows us what restaurants might be like in the not too distant future.\n",
      "A very good, interactive environment, ideal to go as a couple or with friends.Excellent food, price a bit high, but worth it.An excellent treatment, attentive, fast and fun.Without a doubt, Victor gave us excellent attention throughout the dinner.It is very important and more advisable to go with a reservation because you can risk running out of a table.\n",
      "I didn‚Äôt know what to expect and I leave the restaurant very happy. Of course, the main attraction is the interactive tables, but the food was not bad at all and not as expensive as I expected (at least the main course, the dessert was already overpriced). I really enjoyed being able to play board games and it was an experience I would love to repeat. We were treated very kindly and quickly as we had no reservations but we were able to eat anyway without expecting anything. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Also highlight the musical selection! They were all 80s themes that created a fabulous atmosphere. Oh, and we were invited to a glass of cava at the end! Congratulations to the whole team ‚ú®\n",
      "Without a doubt 100% recommended. I hadn't heard of him and now I can't stop. 5 star attention. A spectacular place and not only for its interactive tables, but for its prompt service and very good cuisine (I mean the food, of course). Excellent presentations. The impeccable place. Ideal environment and clean bathrooms. I can not say anything bad. Without a doubt to repeat.\n",
      "Innovative! I went with my partner and we loved it, the place of 10, the tables are amazing we had fun like children playing different games.The food is very good and the treatment is spectacular üëèWe will return without a doubt and totally recommended.\n",
      "We have gone with quite high expectations and the truth is that they have met them, a restaurant of 10 with a perfect price quality. The rooms have been very very nice and we had a great time! We will definitely be back because we were very pleased! Congratulations to the whole team!\n",
      "It was the first time I went with my girl and the truth is that the place is excellent, the service, the attention, the food and the place is quite cozy and modern.Attention of 10.Very friendly and polite waiters.We will repeat without a doubt\n",
      "The restaurant is super cool. Original and state-of-the-art, never better! The staff are all very friendly, they give you help at any time you need it and they are very attentive. The service is fast and the food very good. A great, fun and entertaining experience.\n",
      "An interactive restaurant, unbeatable staff treatment, very good food. The plus point of interactive whiteboards is great, as you can watch first-rate news, play games while you wait for food. A place to return to and recommended. Do not miss it\n",
      "Very highly recommended! Excellent treatment, exceptional food, with a very good combination of flavors and textures. The technological innovation of using touchscreen tables to order is great. In addition, while you eat you can play dominoes, chess or the little ones coloring. An ideal restaurant for meetings with friends, family meals or as a couple. A restaurant that you must visit! I'll be back for sure ... it has amazed me a lot.\n",
      "I read many opinions about the restaurant before going and everything was very positive and I wanted to try. I finally decided to go with my family and we could not choose better! The food is spectacular, the atmosphere, the lights, the tables ... What tables! With games, you can put your photos, see news ... AWESOME! Something so different that it made us enjoy and disconnect from everything. The attention was incredible, really! It is a site that we will repeat with friends for sure! I give them a 10.\n",
      "Great experience, excellent treatment and food. Very highly recommended! ü§© We had a great time playing games üòõ\n",
      "With a table reserved at 3pm we had half an hour waiting on the street. Once at the table we made and paid for the order and 40 min later, when we complained, we were told that they had a computer problem and it had not reached them in the kitchen. One of the dishes we ordered came without one of the main ingredients ... The manager told us that he would give us the dessert and in the truth he would give us a discount the next time we came back. We refused and said they would pass the incident on to the bosses. Two weeks later they still hadn't told me anything and I wrote. The summary? That it's the fault of technology, COVID or global warming, but that they do it very well and put a lot of effort into it. They offer me a discount so I can go back to their place. All in Spanish, of course. Oh, and with his email I discovered that from the moment you walk in the door until you leave, there are security cameras recording you. From what I‚Äôve been reading it wasn‚Äôt just the day I went there, that these incidents occurred. In short: an original place, fun to go with kids (if you don't want to have too much conversation, because it's noisy), but expensive and with a service in the face of disastrous incidents. I will not go back.\n",
      "A different place to dine. Quite an experience. Good food and spectacular attention.\n",
      "We prepared a surprise for our sister to have dinner at N√úA and it would not have been possible without all the team, we prepared it remotely from Granada and they turned to us at all times and with her, the truth is that the treatment was unbeatable, she was delighted with the restaurant, the food, the staff, the attention and the surprise. Without a doubt, it is a highly recommended site for everything added above ... Exceptional. Thank you so much for everything üíï\n",
      "A first class interactive restaurant, great waitress treatment, very good food, and very nice presentations. The plus point of interactive whiteboards is great, as you can watch first-rate news, play games while you wait for food. A place to return to and recommended\n",
      "A fun experience that will not leave a bad taste on the palate. We taste very good flavors and the fact that you can entertain yourself, returning to our childish spirit painting on the tables. üòâ\n",
      "Great. Exquisite and plentiful lunch. Fun experience. Very friendly staff. 100% recommended.\n",
      "A restaurant to spend a very fun time, playing and laughing non-stop with the touch table that everything is done through it, ordering the food, playing and asking for the bill, very nice all who attended us, thank you\n",
      "An amazing site! The experience is well worth it, both the interactive touch tables and the food are a surprise for the senses.A place to share, enjoy, disconnect and eat well. I recommend it 100%\n",
      "Excellent atmosphere, the touch table; both to choose food and to have fun, it has made me feel like a child. Great food and attention !! Totally Recommended to enjoy a unique experience.\n",
      "The idea is fine, but I recommend going alone with your partner, I find it too antisocial if you meet friends, since you are more aware of the screen than of them, the food is good but the price is high, even ordering the dish by the The menu on the screen was wrong to bring it, too long a wait for dessert, and I don't know if it was the day we went but we had a lot of ambient noise, how do I say the idea is good but some details need to be polished, thanks for the service!\n",
      "Good food, there is a bit of everything, but for me there is still more variety. It's not cheap, but you pay for food and the place is pretty good to go try.\n",
      "A place of 10, great staff, very varied and very good food. Ideal for children, youth and adults. It literally takes you to the future and it is quite an experience. I would repeat without a doubt and recommended 100%.\n",
      "Excellent! After a long time, I thought of N√úA to make the first meeting with my team after the pandemic. Couldn't have made a better choice! The treatment by the staff was impeccable and the food was excellent. I can't help but thank the entire N√úA team for making our meeting something very, very special.\n",
      "A month ago my partner saw a video of the restaurant and he really liked it so a couple of days ago I wanted to surprise him and I reserved a table. The restaurant is super cool and brimming with technology. The attention of the staff was great and the food was really delicious. What caught our attention the most about the place was the possibility of interacting with the table and at the moment of truth it was a bit disappointing given that we sat at a table for 2 and it was very small. The plates do not allow you to use the table and since they take little time to serve you, you hardly use it. Ideally, they could add a support on the side to be able to leave the dishes and thus not have problems when using it.\n",
      "A different and innovative restaurant. I went for the first time and I made a very good choice. The atmosphere is very beautiful, the lights, the food, the treatment ... out of 10 !!The mix of flavors and textures of the food is delicious.What makes the difference is the technological innovation, the tables, even the \"badge\" worn by the waiters is digital.The very close and professional treatment makes you feel very comfortableI recommend it.The future is already present !!\n",
      "We ordered two Smart premium menus and had to bring food. They look like small portions but are very crowded. It is well worth coming. A different experience. You are distracted by rivers. Ideal also for children ... They will not be bored at all ... nor the adults ... although a little slow ... but very kind\n",
      "Great experience! We discovered the restaurant through TikTok and we loved it! We have discovered new and incredible flavors, everything was great and highlight the great customer service, taking care of every detail and always super friendly and with a smile. It was nice to be there. The person in charge always aware that everything was in order. We have loved it, we will return and recommend it! Thank you!!\n",
      "Delighted with the treatment of the restaurant one of the best restaurants where I have been able to eat everything delicious and everything innovative while you eat you can play on the screen table I recommend it 100%\n",
      "The only good thing I can say about the place is that the waiters were VERY friendly, otherwise ... EXPENSIVE prices for the amount of food they put out, my partner ate the plate in 4 minutes and he waited for me üòÇ. As innovative as it is, paying 17 euros for something that was not even the size of the palm of my hand, it seems like a real robbery, no matter how good it is. I will not repeat.\n",
      "very good attention from the staff, very good food and excellent experience.\n",
      "It seems to me a super peculiar place and different from the usual, I recommend it 100% because of how entertaining it is to spend a meal with friends and the food is SPECTACULAR !! üòç\n",
      "I have to say I was going with very high expectations, They started pretty well but twisted very fast. It gives me the feeling that they must be carrying little and they are covering more than they can and they are still finding the formula that works for them.They brought the food to me fast enough but I waited 5-10 minutes for it to be brought to my partner. Anyway, once they brought it to me, the tacos were cold (you could tell they weren‚Äôt done).They brought me the wrong dessert (although they rectified it with a smile and apologized for the confusion, we can all have it at some point) but we were waiting 30 minutes for them to bring us a cocktail, going from the set time.For the music theme: When we walked in we thought ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs a pretty tech, modern and quiet place‚Äù and yes, it‚Äôs for the decor, but the level of music started to go up and they put THREE times the ‚Äúhappy birthday \"of parchment at full volume that went 1. interrupted the conversation I had and 2. I have tinnitus, if I had known I would have taken a few plugs, because after 3 times I ended up with a headache.\n",
      "Excellent place to eat with friends or family. The decoration, the atmosphere and the interactive tables transport us to a very fun and curious futuristic place. Laughter will be assured. But the best thing is not only this, but the menu matches perfectly, some delicious poke bowls, which for my taste are haute cuisine, combined with different tartares, hummus, guacamole that do not leave indifferent at all. Although for me, the biggest discovery has been the cheesecake, AWESOME taste and texture. I will be back very soon.\n",
      "A different restaurant. Good food and technology. Children enjoy and older ones too. You have to reserve.\n",
      "Innovative restaurant with a proposal of healthy and fresh food. Of course, be aware that it is half restaurant and half recreational room and they allow pets, therefore, it takes Ibuprofen; children and not so children screaming, dogs barking and so on. If this doesn't matter to you and you want to enjoy healthy and well-prepared food in an environment where between courses you want to play virtual dominoes and do puzzles, go ahead.\n",
      "A place out of the ordinary with a charm out of the ordinary! The gastronomic experience of the future, with a good atmosphere, good attention from the staff, very good music ... And tactile tables!\n",
      "Great food, great service, and great atmosphere! We have spent a few hours very entertaining playing various types of game at the same table that we ate. Super cool! I will come many more times!And it is even worth coming alone since you will be entertained while you wait for your food to arrive (and you can also play while you are eating: P)Thanks N√ºa!\n",
      "Very fun place, very friendly waiters, everything great! 100% recommendable!! We will be back!\n",
      "Excellent experience both at the level of food, the treatment received, and the experience of combining a good healthy kitchen with technological innovation. Menu with very \"healthy\" and well prepared products. The staff is very aware of their guests so that they feel comfortable in an unusual environment and with a touch screen as a tabletop. Highly recommended for a different evening out of the ordinary in a restaurant. Very pleased to have chosen it through Groupon. Without a doubt, you have to go to be able to say that at least you have been and you have tried it\n",
      "A different place where you can enjoy an intelligent gastronomic experience with your friends, partner or family perfectly because it adapts to your situation.I met him months ago with my girlfriend through a viral tiktok and he caught our attention, although we never thought that when we visited him, we would like him and surprise him so much.The food is delicious from start to finish, the cocktails are delicious and I recommend you try especially the mojitos üòâüòâ and the incredible desserts, I recommend the coulant or the cheese cake üôàüôàAnd the best thing is that getting there is super easy, because it is located in the Gracia neighborhood in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãit has a nearby metro station and bus stops. If you come with your own transport, I would preferably recommend motorcycles, although if you go by car, with patience and luck you will find something ü§≠ü§≠I wanted to share this here with you since it is a site that surprised me a lot and I think it should be known more for its excellent quality üëåüèæüëåüèæüëåüèæ\n",
      "For a long time I had signed up on my MUST GO list at Nua Smart Restaurant.I thought, because I have not gone before. What a place! I have never seen a restaurant like it. Everything is taken care of to the maximum detail.The tables are like giant tablets, where you order your food there, you can play games, read news ...The lighting is amazing, not to mention the food.To start we ordered some chicken wings, an assortment of hummus and then tartare and tataki. All accompanied by an exquisite wine and some mango mojitos. All of 10!Unbeatable service and attention, thank you Victor.An excellent experience that will definitely have to be repeated.\n",
      "The experience has been 10/10, excellent in every way. I have gone with my partner to dinner, we went from Tarragona expressly to try it, and we could not get more right.The food was delicious, a mixture of incredible flavors (what we tried we fell in love with the tacos and chicken wings with spicy sauce). The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãputting the tables as tablets, interactive and corporate allows you to have a completely different lunch / dinner, waiting for the dishes is super fast. In addition, being able to see the photos of the dishes and order directly from the table seemed like a hoot too.However, what we liked the most was not the food, nor the idea, but the waiters. We found an incredible team that gives an attention of 10. They were super attentive, polite and, above all, fun and friendly. Both the guy who attended us upon arrival, as well as the waitresses who attended us, as well as the manager / owner with whom we were able to speak afterwards. All an EXCELLENT treatment, really.We were left with the desire to try one of the desserts that at that time did not fit, so, without hesitation, we will try it again\n",
      "It is a restaurant that offers a true digital experience! You can play with digital discs or assemble puzzles or even view your photos while waiting for your food. To put a but is that it was a bit slow and that the food was not the expectation we expected but it was good that yes! Great desserts !!\n",
      "I give it 5 stars because I can't do it anymore, it is 10. We are regular customers, we have been there many times and we have ordered take away from home (it arrives freshly made, with a presentation and luxury and totally sustainable packaging) The experience is spectacular, I totally recommend it. The place is beautiful, the tables are great, super fun, both to go with friends and with pekes). Exquisite staff treatment. Not to mention the food with an incredible preparation and top quality products. Do not stop trying their desserts !!! I totally recommend it !!!! üòãüòã‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª\n",
      "Overall good to go one day ...Pros:- in our case very punctual and fast- very kind- the place is original- It's usually fun- acceptable food- Good coffee- I haven't tasted dessert cocktailsCons:- Expensive quality / price. I understand that you have to pay for the service of the game tables but 15 Eur for spaghetti and 15 for chicken overcooked with potatoes I find it expensive. 4.20 euros for a clear ...- guacamole and nachos quite bland- the 5-year-old has gotten tired quickly, some more childish games will be missing- we did not find a way to divide the table in two because children without us could play dominoes - score goals that were the best games- theme covid for me the tables very close together I did not have two meters with the side theme that bothers me a lot. In another area 6 tables very close together. I would prefer more space between tables- I don't understand why music is so loudFun but you pay for the service. I would appreciate more space between tables. Kind. A different lunch. The 9-year-old says q the best restaurant where he has eaten!\n",
      "We went a couple of days ago since we saw it on social networks and it caught our attention. The truth is, we were not disappointed. I think it is the only restaurant where you appreciate the delay in bringing you the dishes and thus being able to explore all the options offered by the screens.Make everything so interactive, to ask, play, paint, etc. It makes the eating experience completely different and a lot of fun. The food is very good and some very top flavors mixes (guacamole, salmon tartare ... Highly recommended). To put a fault, I would say that there was little variety, but they told us that it was because of being closed for so long. Very friendly service and it is a Pet Friendly local. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I booked 5 people for dinner at 20.30 but as we are not from Bcn we found a lot of caravan and then problems parking. Wow I called and had no problem. When we arrived we were taken care of by Victor and the truth is that we had more than excellent care. He also discovered by chance that it was my son‚Äôs birthday and that he was 16 years old and then it was already wonderful. QA dessert brought him a lighted sparkler and put him the song \"Happy Birthday\". He freaked out. The food although a hair expensive, for my taste I understand that the place deserves it.\n",
      "I only put 3 stars because I expected it differently. The atmosphere and the very good decoration and the attention quite fast. I see the prices a bit excessive. I did not know it was a Japanese restaurant and I do not like Japanese food very much, luckily there were some things that I could eat but ... a bit disappointing. I was excited and in the end I saw that it was very overrated. I still had a good time\n",
      "The food is very good. We've ordered sirloin, chicken, and tuna tacos to share. The tacos were delicious, my recommendation is the sirloin. They are accompanied with a sauce that gives them a fresh touch. I had tuna tartare for the main dish and my friend salmon. She highly recommends the salmon tartare. Finally we ordered the cheese cake, which along with the taquitos, is the best. The cheese cake is delicious and very creamy (and fresh that goes very well now in summer). I came for the experience of the smart tables but I also have a very good experience of the food.The smart table also has a super comfortable function and that is that by synchronizing the table with the mobile, you can pay from the mobile without having to take the card out of the bag, or wait for them to attend to pay the bill, it is instantaneous (It is also a good measure for COVID).In general, my assessment is very positive and I will surely repeat the experience.\n",
      "Cool!!!! It is a restaurant with a lot of quality! The food is excellent! Helpful and very friendly staff! It's the only restaurant where I've had fun like a girl ni√±a! While we were waiting for the food we were playing in various games, we have taken a lot of funny photos, even the man (I think it was the boss or the manager üòÅ) helped us take the photos !!! The food is quality, the price is right! Desserts ... especially cheese cakes by Albert Adri√° is recommended üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå. And after all this you can print the photos and take a nice memory with you ü§©\n",
      "I have had a unique and very good experience. Delicious food and the tables are entertaining.\n",
      "I really liked the restaurant, very innovative, the tables are like giant tablets where you can from playing to ordering your food, and even paying. The food delicious, I have no fault, the exact portions. I'll be back for sure. The trio of hummus that we tried delicious, with vegetables and toasts.\n",
      "I only have one adjective for tonight's evening, SHOW.We have come at 10:30 p.m., they promptly receive us very kind, I will argue my adjective.My prejudice before entering has been literally \"I'm going to be hungry\", a lie.While we were waiting playing the interactive table (very original), dinner has arrived.The tataki and tacos have been sublime, not to mention tartar, at its exact point of spice, something that many sushiman forget. All accompanied by biscuits and a lot of kindness on the part of David and Victor. We ask for a portion of guacamole, they often tell us that they don't have any left, they compensate by putting more quantity in the poke, another show of flavors.In short, we came for the grace of the smart roll, but we are delighted by how well my partner and I have had dinner.Thank you with all my heart for the service and the special attention of David.Good luck and congratulations to the team, you have earned every letter of this review.\n",
      "We have gone for the birthday of my 10 year old daughter and spectacular. We have had a lot of fun. And the food was very good.They have had various details with us.We will be back for sure.\n",
      "Strange feeling. The place is very nice, the screens on the table are wonderful, but the atmosphere there does not fit at all with everything that happens inside. A noise more typical of a nightclub than a place to eat, aggravated also because they put THREE times the song of \"happy birthday\" of parchment. That looked like a sort of Chiquipark. The food is very nice and well presented but tasty, just right.The service is not too good, they are oversaturated but luckily with the table screen you can have a lot of fun killing the wait. The price is certainly expensive for food, but I understand that in a restaurant like this you pay for the experience and the screens.A place with a lot of potential but for now it is just a curious place.\n",
      "Have you ever been to an arcade to eat well? Well, this would be the most graphic description. Everything is displayed on the digital table, which by the way is a bit dizzy. After sitting down, you have to pair your phone with the table (I didn't like it that much). You order through the digital table without knowing very well what, since to order a menu, you must first have studied the dishes separately. There is no specification in the menu of dishes or supplements. When you finish selecting everything, remembering what the initial menu costs, you do the subtraction and you know how much more expensive the dish you have chosen is. The food itself is good, the quality product. For my taste it is a very limited offer. As you criticize some dish, I would say that the fruit salad, which by the way is called almost the same as a mochi, was very good, but they have not removed the durices and there has been a piece of crust that has reminded me that I should go to the dentist. Having a digital table under the food is a bad idea, the dishes that you require to eat with your hands taste like hydroalcoholic gel ... a shame. You had to know the experience ... I hope the future of gastronomy is not like that.Food: 4/5Site: 2/5Attention / service: 3/5Value for money: 3/5\n",
      "Great experience, delicious food, great surprise with the quality. The setting and nice and the smart screens it was absolutely brilliant. Great time.\n",
      "We have loved N√úA. We had a GREAT time, it is a fun and interactive place. We have had a lot of fun. You can not stop visiting. Very good food and drink choices. We have already been twice.\n",
      "Spectacular site !! Very friendly waiters and all great! The digital tables one last time and at the end they invited us to a glass of cava. I plan to return. I recommend it 100%\n",
      "The experience is fun until the food arrives. In the image the plate is very beautiful and colorful with many ingredients and with a high price since a bowl can be around 15 euros and the amount is reduced. The chicken in the bowl in the image comes out marinated, juicy and brown in a soy sauce like the one in the tacos, but the reality is very different. Dry chicken from the breast part, white as if it were steamed ... The bowl of rice noodles is eaten with a fork but it comes with 3 fingers of water or \"broth\" that has no flavor. It also did not have chives and the mushrooms look like canned, nothing to do with the image of the dish displayed on the screen. In general food without any flavor, little quantity, poor preparation and very fair quality. Regarding prices and those details that make you go through a bad experience, a Nestea ‚Ç¨ 3.20 and it comes hot without spending even 10 minutes in the fridge. I'm sorry to put this criticism but the disappointment and the feeling of wasting money is very high because no matter how much fun the theme of the tables is, people go to a restaurant to eat.\n",
      "The menu does not make any sense, it is too expensive ‚Ç¨ 15.9 per drink, a plate (not very big or of great quality) and a coffee (cut or plain). The rest have a plus.The table screens are fine for a while, but they don't have many games.You pay a lot for the experience / silliness of the tables.I would not go back and I do not recommend itVery nice staff\n",
      "The restaurant is amazing with interactive tables, you can look at photos, play games and choose the menu from the same screen of the table! Excellent food and you can create your plate by choosing the ingredients. Optimal service, all staff very friendly. What else to say, we will be back soon N√ºa! Thanks for everything!!\n",
      "Good attention üòåDelicious food!!\n",
      "An innovative restaurant with giant tablet-type tables, where you interact to place your order, play games, read the latest news, share photos, etc. etc.A great attention and some exquisite dishes, really.\n",
      "Very original and fun! The tables are large touch screens where you can play various things alone or with the others at the table, change the wallpaper, ... And you order food from the same table / screen !!! The food is very good and good quality, at least what we have asked for, all the staff have been very friendly and attentive. Highly recommended whether you are going with friends, partner or children.\n",
      "An unbeatable experience ... different, fun, great food, spectacular desserts, but undoubtedly the best treatment, attentive and friendly staff, which makes the visit even more interesting, 100% recommended. We will return without any doubt\n",
      "Very original, fun for everyone! Spectacular service and food! We will be back!!!!\n",
      "The restaurant is very good and very original. You can enjoy a magnificent afternoon or evening with your friends playing while you also eat. However, you have to take into account the prices. It is not a cheap menu and some dishes are expensive for the amount they offer. Otherwise very good service.\n",
      "Highly recommended especially to go with children :) The place is very well set and decorated and the tables are amazing! We play various games (Domino, chess, puzzles, etc.).Very good food and prompt and attentive service.Thank you!\n",
      "Super good experience, the atmosphere is great with the music and the led lights on the screens and others, the food is very good in my opinion the portions are good size to be able to order dessert afterwards and not go out rolling or that you have over food as in many restaurants , the treatment by all the waiters has been excellent, very attentive and friendly it is our first time and we will return for sure üíïP.S. There is a review in which there is talk of a conflict seen by 'a couple' the couple was us and that review is false, the customers have been rude to the waiter and we do not agree with the attitude of those customers, our experience has been 10/10 ‚ú®\n",
      "Innovative, different and original. It is worth trying and repeating for the quality of its dishes. The unbeatable attention, both from the waiters, the meter and the manager. The wait is made pleasant thanks to the interactive games on the table (ideal to go with children!)\n",
      "A restaurant to return to. Children and adults have a great time playing with the table. A very fun experience. And the food very good too. The chicken strips in batter with potatoes were terrific. Ideal to go with children. We will definitely be back\n",
      "Incredible place to have a good time. Ideal if you go with teenage children or as a family. All attention to detail. We will be back!!!\n",
      "Very original place and the treatment is excellent. Great food!It was a friend's birthday and the staff have been great when it comes to taking out the birthday cake.Thank you!!\n",
      "Very nice and new place, good food and excellent care. To repeat ....\n",
      "Very original and fun restaurant! The table is a panel where you order food and have games to entertain you for a while! The food is very tasty and the waiters who served us were great. I will repeat!\n",
      "We went because it caught our attention as it is something that is not usually seen. The place is very well decorated and the staff is very attentive, however, we find it a bit expensive in relation to quality and one side of the screen did not work well. Varied menu and we really liked that each dish had its own video.\n",
      "The best time to go is in the first hour, from 1 p.m. From 2pm onwards I think it is already saturated and the time you ask to enter depends on when tables are emptied. In our case we were treated very well, it was the first time, they explained everything very well, between the tapas and the main course took a while but at the same time if you want to play with the interactive table is already appreciated. Don't go in a hurry, no time to leave. All very good, very good value for money. The leads fell once but I think with so much technology it doesn't surprise me ... Then it restarted and no problem. We will be back, especially in the early hours. Maybe they need to adjust the booking timings ... although it has to be complicated ...\n",
      "It is the perfect plan if you want to celebrate a birthday with your colleagues in an original way! Ideal if you go with small children since it is impossible for them to get bored or tired of being seated with its interactive tables full of games. Super good food. I found the option that you can go with your dog and have food for them. It gives the feeling of being in a futuristic movie, but the waiters are not robots haha ‚Äã‚Äãit is a super nice staff. An atmosphere of good vibes. I totally recommend it! Bravo\n",
      "Very good value for money. Technological experience to try! Team and staff of 10.\n",
      "It has been a unique experience, the staff very friendly, very professional and very attentive. ElmElAmazing, quality of 10 and V√≠ctor a @ very kind, attentive, caring person ...The interaction of board games are fantastic and a lot of fun. My husband and I are delighted and will be back with family and friends.Recommended by.Thank you so much for everything Victor and colleagues üòä\n",
      "Spectacular site! Victor attended us with his total sympathy, like the rest of his colleagues, the food was very good and fast! Quality price of 10, totally recommended üòä\n",
      "We got to know the restaurant through a video on TikTok and we were struck by the tables with the touch screens and the games. We went with a friend and we couldn't have been more delighted - simply SPECTACULAR. Delicious food and super dishes made with quality ingredients. The setting of the place with the screens is super innovative and fun: you can order at any time through the screen (viewing each dish with a short video that will make you want to order the entire menu) and paying through your mobile phone from super fast way. Also, you can have a good time with your friends playing different games like puzzles, airhockey, 2048, etc. or see the news or photos that you can import from your mobile phone.On the other hand, the service is unbeatable - the staff is super friendly, friendly, super attentive and very fast that will make this visit to N√úA Smart Restaurant an unforgettable experience - I don't have to say it but we will repeat it without a doubt. You are awesome!!\n",
      "It is an experience that you have to live at least once. Not only do you eat delicious dishes but you also have a great time and the service from the staff is unbeatable.Super recommended! You have to try it and we will definitely repeat it.\n",
      "It is something different and fun, great to go with children. Excellent service and very good food.We will certainly repeat.\n",
      "We went to celebrate an anniversary with some friends and we loved the experience. Fantastic food, super friendly staff, and great interactive tables! You can play, paint, create, it's so much fun.\n",
      "Great, quirky and fun restaurant for kids. And the food is excellent. Very good experience for the whole family.\n",
      "The place is very original, something new and novel. Very rich food and Victor a genius!\n",
      "Spectacular!! Modern place, charming staff, super attentive. The brutal food !!! To go with children ideal. My 10 year old son was blown away by the display table. Highly recommended. We will repeat for sure !!!\n",
      "Incredible restaurant, we arrived 15 minutes later than the reserved time and while we waited for our table they offered us cava (a great detail). We had a very fun evening, and the food was very good. The price is adequate if we take into account the experience they offer (you can even share photos from your mobile on the interactive table). We will certainly repeat. And the magnificent service, attentive at all times and charming!\n",
      "A different experience, an excellent service, however I think the menu should be worked on a little more and the price of some dishes is somewhat excessive.\n",
      "Excellent experience. Good food, great service, very nice staff. We went with the child and the experience was unique, he was amazed. Surprised in all respects. The food also has its originality, it goes beyond the typical of a restaurant and that gives it a great differential value. The experience with the screens while you eat is simply great, your time flies by.The treatment of the staff was excellent. Keep going\n",
      "Very good experience. The truth is that I highly recommend it.Good food and entertainment guaranteed. Very innovative restaurant in terms of spaces and gastronomy. Very attentive and pleasant staff. A great find.\n",
      "A very innovative restaurant, the delicious food and the ability to play both individually and with the other diners at your table makes your time fly by. The staff is very nice and very attentive. For those who have dogs, they allow them to pass which I think is a very positive point.Highly recommended place to go as a couple, with friends, to celebrate something ... it's great, a 10/10 site.\n",
      "Very fun and exciting! Luxury food and very good !! I recommend it 100%, I nar with the xuxa and no problem !!\n",
      "The place is small so you have to arrive early to get a place to eat. They still serve quite quickly. The lunch menu is 10 euros (considering the area is a very good price) and includes 2 dishes or pizza, bread, drink and at the end dessert or coffee.\n",
      "Restaurant of 10 !! The quality of the food and the products they use are spectacular, the staff super attentive, but without a doubt, highlighting the service Daniele provides, since it makes the restaurant not 10, but 20! üòâ Don't miss the Bella Italia Table and the pan di stelle dessert‚Ä¶. SPAZIEALE !! Ci vediamo quickly !! Tania & Roberto.\n",
      "Small but cozy place with an authentic Italian atmosphere.Good service and phenomenal attention, particularly from Daniele.However, in our case, the service was VERY delayed, despite the fact that upon our arrival the place had no customers (we were the only ones). Within 15 minutes we were served complimentary bruschetta. The starter, Tagliere Bella Italia (VERY GOOD) took 40 minutes and the pizza, 1 hour. The restaurant gradually filled up, and they even served other diners before us. In the end, we were served Limoncello courtesy of the house.\n",
      "I love it, it is one of the best Italian restaurants in bcn. Great price quality. We will always return! 100% Italian products!\n",
      "Menu of the day (1 dish ‚Ç¨ 8: drink + dish + dessert)- noodles (in theory they are with pesto but it takes super little).- biscuit was fine, but no more.Overall good but I've been wanting to try the pizza (they told us there was no dough left).\n",
      "Marvelous!Like having a little piece of Italy in Barcelona. The food was delicious, and the service, in our case from Daniel, was unbeatable. Always attentive, with good recommendations, which were totally correct and the detail of inviting us, to a few pieces of courtesy focaccia while we waited, was appreciated.All the dishes we tried were spectacular and have a very good quality / price ratio.We will return without hesitation.\n",
      "Small restaurant but with abundant and delicious food. All the dishes are homemade. THANKS to Renata for making us discover the tasting menu and her welcome and service I recommend it and we will return very cheap prices. Bye\n",
      "A very nice place to eat Italian, totally recommended and a good place to find Italian cuisine in Barcelona. I ordered the menu of the day which consisted of a first and second (if you want to add) drink, coffee and dessert for only ‚Ç¨ 10. The Spaguethis with 4 cheese sauce and truffle essence, for my taste the pasta was a little salty, but very good as the truffle essence was quite noticeable and makes the dish perfect. The scallopina with cheese and ham, with a carpet of roasted potatoes, was a well-chosen dish.The only negative to add is that they hadn‚Äôt finished the first ones yet and already had the second ones on the table, they don‚Äôt give much time to finish eating. But for the rest very well, my partner ordered the second devil pizza which was also very good and quite spicy. Thank you so much for letting me discover these places in Italy in the center of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwe will be back.\n",
      "A wonderful place!! Authentic Italian trattoria! Renata the waitress super helpful and always loving !!!! We are fans!\n",
      "Very cozy atmosphere, very friendly staff. Ideal for couples. Good value for money. Recommendable.\n",
      "The food was very good, we were surprised, a place with a quiet atmosphere and exquisite attention\n",
      "Very good service with a calm and beautiful atmosphere. The food was delicious and at a good price.\n",
      "Highly recommended, they serve you super well, very friendly, and the food is very good and of good quality. The place is very cozy, we will return for sure.\n",
      "Insider tip, food very good and unusual, ambience and service after better! Discovered by accident.\n",
      "All delicious, very tasty and at a very good price.\n",
      "It was my partner and I. Good service and correct food but very expensive for what they really offer. We ordered a starter, a hamburger (only the meat) and a sea bass (both dishes quite basic), two beers and a water for ‚Ç¨ 53\n",
      "We came here after reading several reviews, looking for a typical place in the old quarter of Barcelona.Very nice place, clean and with an old-time decor. Curated.Italian staff who allowed us to choose by playing it safe.Great food.Honest prices.To come back!\n",
      "Beautiful, small, cozy, welcoming, warm and peaceful atmospheric restaurant. Perfect for a pleasant couple dinner. Young staff very friendly and always available. Dishes offered of excellent quality at a really low price. Mix of tradition and innovation between Barcelona and Italy. Maybe Catalunya would take more! The only flaw is the small and somewhat uncomfortable tables. Absolutely to try at least one evening! Definitely recommended! @ gargio76\n",
      "An ideal place to spend a quiet evening in good company. Competent service and well-crafted, spot-on food.Recommended without a doubt.\n",
      "We came across this place almost by chance. We ordered both meat and fish all excellent especially the tuna and the grilled fillet. Desserts are the icing on the cake. The dark chocolate with vanilla ice cream is remarkable. Friendly staff. Medium / high price but worth it\n",
      "I went yesterday with a friend and although the service and food were correct, as we approached 12 at night, we were on the terrace finishing a wine and they did not stop hurrying us and insisting that we leave the table safe in the law when by law have to close 12.30, and all the bars next door with full terraces and they super edges throwing us when they still had to finish making the box and cleaning, said by themselves. Nonsense, I end up ruining our evening. I would not return nor recommend it. Very rude.\n",
      "Very nice and cozy place. Very good food, good service. Highly recommended !!!\n",
      "Very good atmosphere and delicious food! The most beautiful service! I will repeat without hesitation!\n",
      "If you are Italian and want to eat well, El salon is special!\n",
      "I really liked the place and the food. Very friendly and attentive service\n",
      "It was extremely comfortable outside. The food was also very tasty and the service very friendly\n",
      "Many foreign guests, so appreciated by tourists, excellent restaurant, fresh food, and attentive service.\n",
      "We ordered 3 entrees for two and everything was great. The little square where the table was was very charming and there was a lot of atmosphere\n",
      "Top with organic wine and good food\n",
      "We booked through El Tenedor a bit randomly and it was a pleasant surprise. The site has many years of history and the dishes were all exquisite. We tried the eggplant terrine, the potato and sausage strudel of the copper and second the stuffed chicken and the duck confit. Excellent. And fantastic treatment.\n",
      "Excellent service, the atmosphere, the food, the attention, all very good. Thanks\n",
      "Beautiful experience in the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãexquisite food suggestions Aubergine Terrine and cod !! Super kindness of the staff, they know how to guide when ordering.\n",
      "Resisting the crisis without ceasing to be a signature restaurant, more than reasonable price for the good quality of the material. All exquisite, in Roman Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãsurrounded by walls ... unmatched\n",
      "Flirty and stylish place. Perhaps it is not the best menu you have tried, but the place and the treatment of the staff make it special and to return. Good price!\n",
      "Wonderful service from welcome to departure, friendly and familiar. The spectacular menu, flavors that surprise the palate. Special mention to the fact that they adapted the menu for me since I do not eat meat and without problems they changed some dishes and others adapted them. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Very good food and service. I could only say one not so positive thing, which for me is a problem of this restaurant and most michelin star restaurants: the price of wines. The food is very elaborate and justifies the cost, but with wines and cavas, we all know what they cost in the supermarket or other not-so-up-level restaurants, they shouldn‚Äôt charge what they charge.\n",
      "Almost 4 hours enjoying! Constant flavor bomb dish after dish with impeccable service and attention to detail.Spectacular pairing, I would say one of the best I've made so far in a tasting menu.At the height of the 2 Michelin stars it has.\n",
      "I can definitely recommend a visit to this restaurant.Every course is something new and spectacular and is partly prepared at the table. The service, as it should be for a restaurant of this class, is extremely good.The extremely fair prices should be emphasized. The menu costs ‚Ç¨ 145. A beer ‚Ç¨ 4 and a liter of water also ‚Ç¨ 4. Bread and an appetizer at reception are included.\n",
      "A very special dinner. I wish they got the dishes out faster at this and other michelin stars.\n",
      "SPECTACULAR.That's my word that sums up ANGLE. From the reception in the hall with a small aperitif until the last dessert it was all 10.It was an explosion of flavor from dish after dish. Each plate they brought out surprised me more and more. In addition, all the dishes were taken care of to the smallest detail with the presentation that they had.We did pairing, and the truth that greatly enriched the experience. Since all the wines we tried enhanced the dish 100%. The sommelier introduced us to each of the wines, explained the place of the wine and why it was related to the dish. They were very well done. In addition, it must be said that all the wines were delicious !!!! Moreover, it was the first time that we chose to pair with a tasting menu and it was a success.It should also be noted that the service is extraordinary, the waiters are very attentive, friendly and polite. They explained each and every one of the dishes to us. And many of the dishes were finished on the table, which fascinates us as customers. Watch the product finish on the table.In summary; Highly recommended and I hope to return soon.\n",
      "A real delight for the palate. You will be surprised by its flavor and the on-site preparation of the dishes. A 10 without a doubt.\n",
      "AWESOME.Unbeatable value for money, excellent service from the workers and formidable food and presentation.Super recommended.\n",
      "Some time ago, I went with my family to Angle Barcelona.Our experience there was ...EXTRAORDINARY! We loved it, until a while later we repeat!I leave you photos of the first time.\n",
      "An incredible palate experience. We enjoyed the tasting menu at noon. An explosion in the mouth of flavors and tastes. The innovation, art and infusions in Jordi's dishes are highly recommended and fun to try.\n",
      "Unmatched cuisine, unbeatable service. Eating at El Angle is an experience that transcends the senses. Exquisite dishes, cared for down to the last detail accompanied by great wines. The waiters make it very easy for you to know how to obtain the maximum flavor in each dish.\n",
      "It boils down to an experience where flavor and surprise stand out. Presentation and exquisite description of the dishes by excellent professionals. I recommend it without a doubt\n",
      "Well, a delicate, original and tasty preparation. Although you have to like it and you have to have a great knowledge of cooking to be able to value and enjoy these types of restaurants. Otherwise, it is not worth spending so much money. In my case, I am not the target audience.\n",
      "Grand restaurant was the anniversary of my wife and my two children had a very good dinner cost money but the dinner was excellent, the service was super good, both the service and the food were paid, we were like in a dream. It was brutal.\n",
      "I tried to visit one more time but didn't go to the reservation deadline. The first dish outlines how the rest of the food will taste, and everything from the starter was perfect and delicious. The staff sometimes spoke Korean and was kind. It was a much better time than when I visited Moments.\n",
      "It has been an incredible experience that I highly recommend. Everything impeccable, unbeatable attention. I have been delighted because, in addition, I have enjoyed it with the best company I could have. Unforgettable!!\n",
      "Very good staff attention. The menu good, but maybe I expected something more to have two stars. And things that I would never have imagined finding in a place like this ... A broken plate in the corner and the price of the wine was higher than what was stated on the menu.\n",
      "100% recommended experience, both the service and the food have been much more than up to par. They have exceeded expectations and that they were already high! If I can, I'm sure I'll be back.\n",
      "We only have words of thanks for the treatment offered and for the great gastronomic experience received. Every plate that brought us to the table left us amazed, both to my partner and to me, the art that Alberto, the chef in charge of the Angle, and Jordi Cruz, is really magnificent. The design of the dishes, the combination of flavors and the choice of pairing, a dinner of 10. We chose the √Ängel Menu, and we were delighted, surely we will return to taste the Great Angle when they change the menu again. Thanks especially to the waiters, who told us very well all the dishes, the sumillier, who made us enjoy tasting, and of course, Alberto, that we could know him first.Thank you very much team!\n",
      "It certainly deserves the star it has.Spectacular service, (in particular Jesus' attention) amazing dishes in presentation, textures and flavor. Perfect lighting to enjoy a magnificent evening.We chose the great Angle menu, but surely the other one they offered would be to our liking as well.Impeccable carabiner, I must say.It will be repeated when you can, no doubt.\n",
      "Incredible smoked dishes and all the exquisite tasting dishes with important contrasts of flavors and haute cuisine methods the very attentive and spectacular service the sommelier upon learning about the extensive wine list\n",
      "A gastronomic journey that amazes your senses.\n",
      "We have enjoyed a tasting menu (the great angle) with amazing dishes in regards to taste, textures, presentation and contrasts.The service is exceptional, more than in other restaurants at this level.Show the Catalan product in the explanations of the dishes and the wines.Very recommendable for a celebration.Thanks to all the team\n",
      "Restaurant reserved for our anniversary.Excellent in every way: the food, the service, the experience. It is to date the best restaurant that we have done and what particularly sets it apart is the experience with each dish (it starts with the revisited \"mojito\" tasted at the bar, the cooking of the bouillabaisse on the table. , the preparation of the tartare before our eyes ... and I say no more because there are many surprises during this meal).Beyond the experience, the cuisine is fabulous, the flavors combine wonderfully, the tastes are surprising and authentic. The advice on the wines is also up to the place, and the service impeccable.Thank you for this moment which will remain engraved in our memories!\n",
      "Impressive everything. The staff, the treatment, the food. Amazing.\n",
      "The angle A true festival for the senses! ‚ù§Ô∏è Creativity and concentrated flavors. Surprises and games. Tradition and territory. Office in the kitchen and fun at the table. Jordi Cruz shows us his rogue and cunning character. A show like few can have in the great gastronomic capital! We'll be coming back!\n",
      "Two people went and ate 125 euro course. I've given you 5 stars because there are so many people looking at this ... I don't really have any money.\n",
      "We have lunch there on August 8th and it was a shock! Inventive and surprising cuisine. Exceptional flavors combined with a crazy staging! Everything's in the details.You are at the center of an unforgettable culinary experience where everything is done to surprise you with taste. The setting is beautiful, the staff fantastic. To be done again very quickly during our next visit to Barcelona.\n",
      "Exceptional restaurant in which to enjoy an unforgettable experience. With an unbeatable treatment, from the first moment, at reception you realize the difference and exquisiteness of the place. Very elaborate dishes that enter by sight and seduce the palate. Fully recommended\n",
      "An expensive but amazing experience. Delicious and amazing food and unbeatable treatment.\n",
      "Very well.The team has advised us and has always been on top of our needs and concerns - to a fair extent -.Very good everything.\n",
      "Angel barcelona's set meal, 90 sets of 9 courses, friends said that there is too much stronger than a Japanese two stars.Some dishes are really creative, and the amount is not enough. If you are willing to eat for two or three hours, you can try it.\n",
      "An exquisite tasting menu. The environment is super nice and the treatment of all the impeccable service. They are pending of every detail. 100% recommended for a charming evening.\n",
      "The 2 newly earned Michelin stars deserved. Creativity and originality, impeccable service, elaboration and perfect presentation. Extensive menu without getting tired. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Indescribable, an incredible gastronomic experience! A 10!\n",
      "Awesome experience. Great food and better deal. 100% recommendable\n",
      "Restaurant with a Michelin star that offers two tasting menus, one short (90 euros) and one long (115 euros). I tried the short menu. Dishes visually spectacular and with an excellent flavor. Although I expected something else .... An incredible technique with an exceptional raw material. The treatment of the staff is excellent, very formal, but at the same time, pleasant. Highly recommended!\n",
      "We were 6 people and ate the Wide Angle menu. As a wonderful restaurant, but as a restaurant with 1 * michelin it has its lights and shadows.First of all highlight the professionalism and friendliness of the room staff. A 10!Of the dishes on the menu, there are several that stand out (maresme peas, carabineros head, broths / infusions ...) for the raw material, and others that don‚Äôt really fit (gintonic dessert for example).Highlight the great wine list!The big problem of our experience was the times of the \"pass\" of the dishes. The first 3 entrants came out with a 20 minute difference between them. Considering it‚Äôs a single bite and the menu has about 12 dishes, we found it excessive. As we progressed on the menu it got better, but really the whole table complained about it.Still I recommend the restaurant! You will surely have more luck with the tempos!\n",
      "Very nice atmosphere. The friendly, professional and attentive service. Spectacular menu, a gastronomic experience that must be tried ..\n",
      "Very well set up place, the original and perfectly presented menu, one of the things that we liked is the treatment of the people who attended us, very efficient, friendly who make you spend three hours at a time\n",
      "We really liked the restaurant. At the beginning they make the reception explain the menu that has two tasting menus. Once you have chosen, you are presented with 3 starters in a bar with a chef, it was a very pleasant and close moment and I must say that they were very good. Then you go up to the dining room with elegant tables and a very romantic dim light. We chose the Angle menu. The final price was about 230e including the menu for two, coffees, wine and water. It was a very correct menu where the duck dish and the coconut dessert stood out above all. I've been to other Michelin stars and this one has some points that I liked since they try to make the diner participate in the dishes.\n",
      "Good gastronomic experience. Value for money highly recommended. To highlight the starter of mussels. All dishes are presented and briefly explained with great professionalism.\n",
      "Patetico, this is the only way to describe that experience, a show thinking that diners have never tried eating in a good restaurant. Except for the dessert cheeses that the chef did not make them, the rest is much richer in any boqueria stall.\n",
      "Lunch as a couple. Tasting menu. Original, well presented and explained, and a festival for the palate ... Amazing ...\n",
      "Top tent if you like nice good tasty food. The wine package consists mainly of regional wines. Delicious. Nice service. They do keep up the pace. That could be tempered somewhat.\n",
      "I would not recommend it. They put the signature of a good cook so that more people go but it is not worth what it costs. It is a pity. It is all right simply.\n",
      "Apart from an unexpected culinary experience, we got a wonderful show!\n",
      "Very good restaurant, with two Michelin stars. We ate the tasting menu without pairing, consisting of several appetizers, several starters and several main courses, followed by two desserts or a selection of cheeses.Seafood prevails on the menu, treated with delicacy and respecting its flavor, although there are some meat dishes such as sirloin Wellington or Iberian fritter that shine with their own light.The exquisite attention to the diner, having the table with ingredients that would be added to the successive dishes or the preparation at the table of some of them only add to the pleasant experience of a dinner in this restaurant.\n",
      "Spectacular. We tried the 8-course Angle menu. Dishes that are very powerful in flavor and with colorful presentations, each one surprising in a different way. Enough quantity, you fit well\n",
      "I was expecting a little more, even though power had expectations too high.\n",
      "Spectacular wide angle tasting menu. Good attention and service from the room team.\n"

      "An incredible experience!We went on Sunday to make the menu with pairing and we were amazed at the subtlety, flavor and distinction of the dishes, cared to the millimeter. They were very kind and understanding when changing me a seafood dish that I did not like, and they also asked if we had a food allergy. On the other hand, the pairing perfectly accompanied each of the dishes, the sommelier what poet, transported us with his hasty descriptions and made us understand the reason for the mixture. The room team was super efficient and attentive at all times. They explained each dish with great care making us feel part of the Angle family, and that is priceless!We were a little more than 3h, which flew by! We will repeat without hesitation!\n",
      "An incredible restaurant. Presentation, attention of the waiters, explanation of each dish. Come on, a restaurant show.\n",
      "Spectacular restaurant! Very good food, excellent service! Flavors that you will not find in many places !! In a good location in the center of Barcelona !!!\n",
      "An extraordinary experience! We took the tasting menu and it was a gift for the senses! Splendid attention Absolutely advisable!\n",
      "Culinary, very good experience, very careful and elaborate menu, although not surprising.The place has little charm.\n",
      "2 star restaurant, tasted very special things, surprising.\n",
      "The noon tasting menu is perfect in terms of quality, creativity of the dishes, quantity and price. Very friendly and professional service. A perfect experience. We will surely repeat to try the tasting menus!\n",
      "Out of 10. We ate one of the tasting menus and we will surely try the others again. From surprise to surprise. A pleasure for the senses. A concentration of flavors. And the quantities seem small, but they are just ... we have ended up full. Everything exquisite, difficult to highlight one dish over another.The modern and cozy place. Very attentive service and explanations of the dishes to be appreciated.\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised. Very good tasting menu but something scarce. We went for dinner so we ordered the short menu. If it is not for the bread, we are a little hungry. The dishes I suppose are more thought for the longer menu. Anyway, all the dishes are very good and surprising. In fact I'm left with a better taste in my mouth than in the abac. They can be almost at the same level. The appetizers I liked a lot more. It is also good that they have a vegan menu and that is a point in favor since in many restaurants they do not even want vegans to go because they will not be able to eat anything. What we did not see very well is that the price was the same (although we understand that making an exclusive menu for that person has his work equal or more).\n",
      "The food was just top class. In addition the service very attentive and outstanding. However, unfortunately, 1-2 serving errors, bottle was put on the glass when pouring. Before the dessert course was also once spilled while pouring. All in all not bad, but if you want to the two star level, you should still perfect in these points. The food left a lot to be desired. Only the vegetarian course of my company was served on a Himalayan stone and was unfortunately a bit difficult to handle. And it was said that everything should be eaten in one, but some fish juice was too much, so my companion had something to do with this dish.\n",
      "Site with elegance, cozy and with good accessibility. Located in the center of Barcelona.It has several tasting menus. We have gone a couple of times to try the angle and large angle menu.Our last visit was a bit run over. The food is very good and the preparation is creativeHowever, the service that night was somewhat short. One of the diners has an intolerance to a food, we discussed it at the time of booking and in the same restaurant. They made the two different dishes but they just put the plate that brought that food to the diner who had the intolerance. From that moment I had to go to the bathroom several times and became quite indisposed. We also had paid for cocktails and therefore we could not continue with what was planned.They apologized several times and told us if they could help something. We understand that it is something that can happen, although I think it is something serious and more in a site of this level. What made us worse was that they did not have any details, nor did any compensation come from them. We had to ask that at least they give us a bottle of wine since we would not go back to that place again and I did not want to continue with cocktails. For all this, I give that score even knowing that the food is of good quality.\n",

Anyway ... I think I made myself understood.Very good cumin. Very nice the blackboard with colored chalk where the menu appeared, the waitress was very attentive and helpful.

The poor woman must, smiling, do everything: take orders, cut and heat food, make the bill, clear the table and so on. They have one of the most strategic locations in the Born, I do not want to deal in his pocket to anyone but the owner should seriously consider hiring a person at least on weekends or public holidays .. the good product is not enough unfortunately, service is 50% of a commercial activity. For this I leave 3 Stars.\n",

The manners he has had were very out of place. He had never seen this situation or anyone who screamed.

We picked \"Biltong\" which are pieces of dried meat that reminded me of a very dry espetec with plenty of pepper; and some juicy chicken wings. As a main course chicken strips with their exquisite sauce (similar to a curry). All this accompanied by a soft South African beer. As if all this weren't enough, we finished with a fluffy Malva Pudding. To lick your fingers!\n",
      "Really magnificent. A meal of 10 in terms of the compositions of each dish, from the pre to the final dessert. The place is cozy and quiet. All staff very friendly. A pleasant experience to repeat without a doubt.\n",
      "100% Recommended and affordable.We booked by fork to make the 5 course menu for ‚Ç¨ 65. The best idea!The menu is seasonal and changing. When you arrive they ask you if you have preferences and from here on it is a surprise, which I really liked. If you are to eat everything, it is great!I highlight the taste and masterful mix of textures. All a 10.We will be back.\n",
      "Amazing from start to finish. Starting with the service, careful and exquisite, and ending with the fabulous menu. ‚Ç¨ 65 of delicacies with fennel as a common thread, surprising and delicious. Without a doubt to repeat and at the level we expected. It has been a pleasure, thank you!\n",
      "We ordered the 5 course tasting menu and it was spectacular. Each dish is a unique explosion of flavor.To be a Michelin star, the price of ‚Ç¨ 65 plus the drink is more than justified.In addition, the attention of the staff is excellent, very attentive and polite. They explain the composition of each dish and answer any questions.A highly recommended experience.\n",
      "Amazing value for money. You notice the experience at Lasarte and wanting to offer something different that does not cannibalize each other. Quality product, excellent service. Definitely to go back\n",
      "First of all it is fair to point out that each of the dishes is very good and very well crafted. However, the set offered to us in the tasting menu is, for our taste, decompensated. They weigh too much foie, mushrooms, too intense flavors, present in three of the five dishes. Suffice it to say that what we celebrate most is the salad, amazing, refreshing and very varied in tastes and textures. Desserts also excellent.On the other hand point out that the waiting time between dishes has been excessive, as if the kitchen did not give within reach.\n",
      "Second time we visited a Michelin restaurant in Berasategui. It does not fail. Custom 5-course menu. You come out quite satisfied.\n",
      "Executive menu at noon. Incredible quality and level. The price deserves to be repeated over and over again. Club!\n",
      "Well balanced tasting menu, surprising, never the same and well executed. We have really enjoyed the whole experience !! A thousand thanks to all the staff for your attention !! Celebrating a great birthday !!\n",
      "Spectacular, the experience is brutal, the dishes are in small quantities but with many different flavors that intertwine and make you enjoy. Highly recommended.\n",
      "I was expecting a little more since it is a restaurant with 1 Michelin star, the food is very careful and the quality product, although I expected a better explanation and to be able to see the ingredients of each dish somewhere.The menu can be accessed using a QR code and it is something that could be easily updated and the ingredients for the dishes added; It is a suggestion that I think the diner would appreciate.Price according to what you ask, although I consider the price of ‚Ç¨ 6 for a glass of draft beer to be excessive.The place is typical of a hotel, very sober, without more.\n",
      "Great visit to the Oria de Martin Berasategui, beautiful place, impeccable attention, good tasting menu with the correct number of dishes so as not to end up rolling. Super correct price to be a michelin star. Spectacular starters, rice of 10, to put one but, I would change the meat for another type, on the same plate, a bird. All incredible. 100% recommendable.\n",
      "Simply spectacular!!Textures and flavor.Excellence.Service.\n",
      "Excellent food.Lovely site\n",
      "An unforgettable experience. They made us a gift consisting of a tasting dinner with pairing that has turned out to be a success. The treatment, from the moment you enter until you leave, is exquisite. Dinner consisting of 10 courses plus 3 for dessert, a dream. Thank you very much for the treatment and your professionalism.\n",
      "They have 3 menu formulas in one of them you choose the price from ‚Ç¨ 60I chose the executive menu ‚Ç¨ 453 appetizersA first a second a dessert coffee and petits fours.Very completeFrom start to finish a fantastic gastronomic experienceImpeccable presentation of the dishesPerfect workmanship.Good modern local environment and with all security measures due to covid19.Staff very friendly and professional.The Michelin star is well deserved and they will surely look for the second one soon\n",
      "A wonder for all the senses. As could not be expected otherwise, a service of 10 with an unbeatable gastronomic offer. I will certainly repeat the next time I return to Barcelona\n",
      "We were there on Saturday and enjoyed the ‚Ç¨ 95 tasting menu. It has 1 Michelin star but it deserves more (or not, because then it will become more expensive and we will not be able to enjoy it as we have done). Much better than other restaurants with more Michelin stars. All the dishes are absolutely delicious and above all the fish, simply sublime\n",
      "'Oria', a Michelin-starred fine dining restaurant, located at the Monument Hotel in BarcelonaThe lunch course costs 60 euros for 1 person. Reservations are required. When I visited, there were not many people.The atmosphere is very fine and luxurious, and the staff are friendly.Every food is beautiful, delicious and wonderful.The risotto was especially interesting and there were three different desserts available.You can choose the main dish according to your taste.If you want to experience the finest fine dining in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthis is the place to go.\n",
      "Can syrups! We ordered the nine course tasting menu. In the different dishes, the protagonists were sauces, mousse, oil and jellies; where was the main product? The tastings should be a balanced size to taste and enjoy the flavors. We did not find the surprise and excellence required in a star restaurant. A disappointing experience.\n",
      "Good food and great service and customer care\n",
      "A great restaurant by Martin Berasategui\n",
      "The place is cozy and quiet, inviting to be. The staff are friendly and very professional. The tasting menu is well balanced, the dishes very well presented with a very successful mix of flavors and colors. I liked all the dishes, except for the Iberian prey, which for my taste the texture of the meat was not adequate and the dish itself did not seem up to the rest of the dishes on the menu. Excellent desserts. The wine list is extensive, served at the correct temperature, the prices too high resulting in a value for money that does not correspond to the wine you are drinking. I totally recommend the restaurant for the quality of the food, the staff and the venue.\n",
      "Excellent!\n",
      "Excellent restaurant endorsed by a great chef like Berasategui!\n",
      "We loved it!We decided to take the 80 ‚Ç¨ tasting menu, it was all very good.In our case we do not order wines.They were very friendly from start to finish and the atmosphere was calm.Bad luck was that we met a couple of rude men at another table who thought they were alone in the place and it broke the charm a bit.\n",
      "Well-deserved Michelin star, congratulations to the entire Oria restaurant team.\n",
      "We have tried the tasting menu, we found it incredible, we have enjoyed the atmosphere, attention and dishes.\n",
      "Very good custom tasting menu!Very quiet dining room, they take care of every detail.\n",
      "The food is exquisite and the staff are wonderful! There are several menu options and you can even make the menu a la carte, however, in order to enjoy the cuisine, I recommend the menu, we made the 9 course and we were very tips .... the best, which is surprise and also at the beginning ask for intolerances, allergies or foods you do not like, great!\n",
      "A flexible lunch menu from 50 ‚Ç¨ announced for 4 courses but which actually contained 2 appetizers, 2 starters, 1 fish and a meat, followed by a pre-dessert and a dessert. What does not come out the empty stomach, but rather the belly and head full of beautiful flavors and sensations.\n",
      "Spectacular food festival and friendly and attentive service. I recommend the executive menu without hesitation! You are in a privileged environment, the Paseo de Gracia, and the decoration of the place is very cool, a very bright and modern place. A ten.\n",
      "Very nice restaurant and helpful staff. We celebrated Valentine's Day. And I'm very glad that my boyfriend chose this place. Romantic and original menu\n",
      "Very balanced dishes, excellently prepared. I have enjoyed blends of flavors that I never imagined could be combined with such wisdom.I recommend it.All three menus are equally enjoyed.\n",
      "The truth is that we were delighted. The food and mixture of excellent flavors, and the unbeatable treatment. It was the first time I went with my partner and we will surely repeat.\n",
      "It's quite famous among Koreans. Michelin 1 star. The course is pretty good for the price. Personally, the fish was more delicious. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is good.\n",
      "Here is a 45 euro course with a nice 3 course menu.However, the #Michelin 1-star restaurant has both good plating, taste, and atmosphere.The temple served as a starter was good, the salad was fresh, the broth sauce was cooked, and some of the trimmed vegetables lined up on the paper like Michelbra were great. .We, of course, were with wide oil. Lol.#Squirrel #Spanish #Recommendation\n",
      "An elegant but informal restaurant at the same time. Efficient service, courteous but too fast and not worthy of a place with a Michelin star where, those who stop there, certainly want to have a new experience and maybe a tasting route where every course cannot be served right after the previous one . Almost all the dishes tasted normal but the wagy√º meat far removed all the others and it was really the top dish in every way. Finally, I would like to say that if you are in Barcelona and you like this type of cuisine, it is certainly worth a visit to the Oria.\n",
      "Exceptional experience in this restaurant. A high quality cuisine, refined and original! Impeccable service and pleasant. Special attention is paid to customers! They deserve their star without a doubt!\n",
      "Compared to consumption in Switzerland, the price of this restaurant is much more reasonable. Two dishes and a children's meal are more than 90 Euros. The beef is very good! ! It used to be more than one hundred and ten euros in Switzerland before, and the beef is still not bad! The service is first-rate, and the waiter will come over to chat from time to time. Every time a dish or pre-dinner bread, dessert will introduce the ingredients used, the chef will also introduce whether he is satisfied with the dishes! We ate in this restaurant for two consecutive nights!\n",
      "A starred restaurant, it is on the Michelin guide and offers a superior service compared to the traditional restaurant.We chose the 7 course tasting menu and I have to say that every single course was really delicious. Also the excellent service thanks to Carmine, the waiter who took care of us the most.At the end, with 2 bottles of wine we spent about 100 euros each and I have to say that given the type of restaurant and the location are an honest price.Recommended!\n",
      "Where to enjoy Michelin at a reasonable priceThe service and food taste goodThe lamb didn't taste right\n",
      "Great, a super-elaborated lunch menu. Elegant and quiet restaurant\n",
      "5-star hotel accompanied by 5-star restaurants. This one in particular, the exquisite menu as well as the attention received, I who did not want meat, had no problem in changing it for a fish.In the hotel hall you can have a drink. I do not think it is ideal for a family with children, better as a couple. the tables are intimate and spacious, details and silence are taken care of.\n",
      "Nice experience. Excellent tasting menu.Very friendly staff\n",
      "[7-star Michelin bistro serving as the main dining area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel]It is a second store developed by Martin Verasateki, who won seven stars in Spain. 3 Michelin stars in Barcelona and San Sebastian, and 7 Michelin 1 star here. Facing Passeig de Gr√†cia, a 3-minute walk from Casa Mira, a World Heritage Site, and close to Casa Batll√≥, it's in a monument hotel, so most shops are open even on Sundays, so it's easy to use in the restaurant, you can enjoy yet cuisine that incorporates the Gasutoronomi.We have a creative cuisine inspired from the Mediterranean Sea, there are a la carte and course. When I did a preliminary survey, the course was large and most Japanese left or fell into a feeling of an all-you-can-eat buffet, so I recommend √† la carte, but I decided to make this course to enjoy the chef's story. With a system that allows you to choose from 5 to 9 dishes, we consulted with the staff and made 7 dishes. The staff says that nine dishes are quite impossible even for Spanish people, what happens to this œÉ (^_^;)Bread: famous croissants and two-colored baguettesFirst appetizer: mustard mousseRefreshing mustard mousse with mussels and green pepper flavor. Ô∏éSecond appetizer: cod surimi croquetThe inside of the rocket is liquid and surprised.„Çπ „É© „Ç§ „Çπ The cod sliced ‚Äã‚Äãchips are served with citron sauce. Melting croquet and crispy chips contrast with yuzu's oriental flavor are exquisite. Ô∏éThird appetizer: cold oystersOysters served with frozen cucumber grated and horseradish mousse sauce at a low temperature and heat-treated? Does the garnish and sauce match together, but the combination of ingredients is unexpected? Ô∏é4th of appetizer: carpaccio salad of octopusAvocado mousse, mango mousse underneath, plenty of colorful vegetables tossed with tomato jelly sauce, a new sense of salad, fresh taste of mousse and vegetables. Ô∏éFifth appetizer: oxtail ravioli with truffle and porto sauce mushroomsAt first glance, a ravioli with an appearance that seems to be a UFO, I did not know whether this was an oxtail, but the rich beef and heavy harmony of the sauce could not be imagined from a bite-sized ravioli‚Äº Ô∏éFish: sea bass, celery mousse, fried small fishI couldn't hear the fish plate because of my lack of English, but I had some liver and a sauce covered with gelatin and served white fish with mousse. The combination that can not be imagined, that the condensed fish flavor adds a punch force to the pale seabass and enhances the fish feeling at once, is wonderful.Main: Sacriram Terrine, Chicken Teriyaki Style Sauteed Edamame and Edamame MousseThe terrine just in front of the little finger is the rich lamb itself, the chicken is an oriental teriyaki, but the texture is like millefeuille and the edamame also has a bright color and a role as a sauce, but I do not understand well but the result is only delicious dish.Pre-dessert: green apple and cucumbers, melon diceExquisite sweetness and cucumber blueness of fruits with gin-based sauce, for the first time experience a refreshing and complex taste that you do not know what to say. Ô∏éDessert: cinnamon iceGarson called it \"cinnamon ice cream\" in a word, but it was a dish that felt like a combination of texture and taste, with ice cream and the supporting parts of pumpkin seeds, coffee mousse, and chocolate.Amuse: coconut marshmallow and almond chocolateThe espresso's companion amuse was light, heavy, sweet, full-bodied, and concluded with the elaborate design of spending a mysterious and sweet time feeling conflicting textures and unexpected volume after eating.The price changes depending on the number of dishes of the appetizer, but the wine is also changed according to the dishes and we have several cups of wine, about 220 ‚Ç¨, and I was surprised at the exceptional cospa as a restaurant gastronomic with a star. Speaking of the number of dishes of 7 dishes, at first I saw the potion of one dish and I got the impression that `` Eh? This is it? '', But as a result after drinking the last coffee it was quite heavy I was informed. Service is also alright, thanks to the fact that it is a valuable experience (^ ^)\n",
      "A safe bet, very good service and very good value for money. Ideal for signature cuisine lovers\n",

      "It is not the first time that I have stepped on a Michelin star, but I have to say that this one has pleasantly surprised me by its delicacy of flavors, its exquisite attention and its pleasant stay. Even my wife, who does not like to eat seafood, has enjoyed the scallop. Anyway, for me, the star dish has been the Iberian prey. An absolute delicacy.\n",
      "We went to celebrate my mother's birthday .. 70 years !! So it had to be a special place ;-)The beauty of this Martin Berasategui restaurant is that you choose the price of the menu; If I remember correctly there were three options. We took the ‚Ç¨ 80 per person. You can say what things you do not like to hit more on the menu because you are crazy with things on the menu but you do not know exactly what they are.The service is excellent and we were very good.For business days there is an executive menu.\n",
      "We really enjoyed the whole experience !! Thank you so much to the whole eqip for the attention.\n",
      "Unbeatable food and service. He has nothing that I do not like. Everything very comfortable! Seafood and very correct meats. Terrific bread! Nice desserts that you 'light up' the day !! It's the only restaurant I want to repeat during my short stay in Barcelona !!\n",
      "Michelin star restaurant located inside the Monument hotel. You can see the hand of the great Mart√≠n Berasategui. Apparently normal and mundane dishes and ingredients are elevated to a higher category. Exquisite dishes and an impeccable presentation. The tasting menu is tailored to the client ... he chooses a price range that is between 50 and 100 euros. The treatment of the staff is excellent, formal but at the same time close. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Well, very good, what you would expect from a restaurant in this category.All very Berasategui. Impeccable service and proven cuisine.A wine list not very extensive but well defined. Many options and price content. For putting a but the small wine glasses in our opinion.Good selection of breads.The starters with basic but well-made ingredients, with its fashionable point ... citrus, Yuzu, a lot of avocado ... The egg at very low temperature, the salad with octopus carpaccio and tomato and lemon water was fresh but it seemed that the m√©zclum was industrial but of quality.The second courses, fish and meat, we found the best, infallible products, sea bass and shoulder, very well prepared and integrated with the rest of the ingredients without leaving or missing anything. Full of colors, textures, aromas and flavors. All this served in suitable and suitable dishes for the dish.The preposter was a little disappointing because it was not original but it did its job to cleanse the palate and introduce the best that was tried that afternoon ... the dessert with coffee cream, chocolate mousse and cinnamon ice cream with its pipes of caramelized sunflower, buah !!! I remember!We recommend the Customized Menu formula, where you set the price you want to pay, between 50 and 100 ‚Ç¨ and the Oria team serves you accordingly. It is for all the diners at the table. We pay ‚Ç¨ 60.\n",
      "This restaurant is located in the Monument hotel. The dinner course was really great. Each course felt full of chef's sincerity\n",

      "Very pleasantly surprised and 100% recommended.It had been a long time since I found in BARCELONA a really risky culinary bet, with high quality and that did not fall into ‚Äúchemical - experimental‚Äù cuisine, but quite the opposite. ..I was very surprised by the great quality of the dishes, very well balanced. And using a local, high-quality and almost unknown product.The first course, Romanesco boiled with cruciferous cream ... amazing. . The cream is spectacular accompanying the mini broccoli and Romanescos. A smooth and balanced flavor. And also the plate had some leaves of a plant in the style of \"crasas\" that has been a discovery. !!100% recommended dish for vegans and non-vegans. !! A 10!Second: Rice with Green Broccoli curry I was especially surprised by the power of the flavor of this dish. The spectacular rice is enhanced with the green curry and the coriander sprouts. .. it is a main course, very well prepared and filling a lot !!Dessert: Tupinambo Tiramisu ... a 10 !! I don't explain it so as not to break the surprise. !!The restaurant's atmosphere is dynamic, young and the service a 10 !! You can see the professionalism of both the living room and the kitchen.The lunch menu is ‚Ç¨ 25 !! A price. Very tight for the good quality of product, service and space.Definitely. Wanting to repeat this time to try the menu of the night.Congratulations to the whole team. It is not easy to surprise with a new product, with quality and well prepared!\n",
      "The restaurant is open at the new five-star hotel Almanac. The interior is modern and stylish. The location is convenient, easy to find.Ordered a set menu, including starter, hot, dessert, water and coffee. The price of this menu is 45 euro per person. I liked everything-tasty, bright, unusual. It is recommended as a restaurant for a romantic dinner, for dinner with occasions. Friendly staff\n",
      "Last night I was having dinner at Virens of the Almanac Hotel, an indescribable experience, we had a tasting menu, the smallest since it was dinner. A real spectacle for the palate, I never believed that vegetables will be cooked to that level, each dish being more exquisite than the previous one, I cannot list which of my dishes was the favorite because each one of them made my palate fall in love, I am a fan of haute cuisine, I have great experiences in the restaurants of the big hotels in Barcelona. Monument, Mandarin, Ohla Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãCotton House and some more, but my experience last night with the Green and Probiotic kitchen has been a great discovery for me, in love with the cuisine of the Virens, I will return and send my friends and family. Thank you Virens for that experience and the exquisite treatment of the staff, especially from PAULINE, her professionalism, PASSION for her work and the affection with which she treated us. I recommend with a 10, the kitchen, the treatment and the place. THANK YOU, I WILL BE BACK SOON!\n",
      "Restaurant of the Hotel Almanac, 5 stars. We really expected more for a Christmas Eve menu. great price, that's true. It lacked a bit of attention from the waiters. But in general the dinner was correct.\n",

      "All great. We went with the ‚Ç¨ 25 menu from the restaurant week of \"El Tenedor\" and it has been an impressive meal. Quality food, beautiful dishes, the environment is ideal and the attention of the staff is also very good.We celebrated my birthday and they had the detail not to include in the price of the bill the cupcake they brought to blow out the candles.Very good place for both romantic dinners and family meals.\n",
      "Impeccable welcome, original menu and extremely tasty, sublime setting with affordable prices (count ‚Ç¨ 18 for the 3-course menu, ‚Ç¨ 25 for the 4-course menu).An address not to miss!\n",
      "Located inside the luxurious Hotel ALMANAC, the restaurant L√≠nia offers us an excellent cuisine with top quality products and a perfect preparation of the dishes. They have a menu, where their specialty is rice and a tasting menu to share 2 good people.On this occasion we opted for this menu of ‚Ç¨ 45 per person to share, I attached the photograph of the letter in case you want to see it.All the dishes on the menu seemed excellent and in the surroundings where you eat we loved it.To emphasize the exquisite attention of the staff especially of Anja that was the one that was pending of us in all moment, an attention like this makes that you have desire to return to eat these magnificent rices that were pending to us ........ Remember that although L√≠nia is located within the Hotel Almanac is open to the public and although the menu may seem a tad high, this is not so, you have to think that the good product, service and environment also has a price.\n",
      "The overall assessment is normal. The menu offered at ‚Ç¨ 45 to share is very poor with very small portions and difficult to share. Added to that the service by one of the waitresses turned out to be very unprofessional. He treated us very arrogantly, discrediting the failures of his companion (more novice). A very ugly detail that we did not like at all. With the exception of the sweet potato ribs and the zen garden dessert (matcha and white chocolate) it was quite surprising (or risky). Coca with tomato and oil, burrata, scallops ... we are not left wanting to repeat.\n",

      "Restaurant well located with a very careful decoration. The service is attentive and the food is quite good, the value for money is acceptable. I would not repeat it but I do not think you can leave unsatisfied, since the menu is quite similar to many other restaurants of the same style.\n",
      "Prepared and high quality dishes, the restaurant is very nice, comfortable chairs to make a table and the best of all is the service, Joan attended us and we give him a 10!

      "I went once and I loved it. But today I brought my parents and the lunch menu of 35 euros seemed unfortunate. Tiny portions. Very slow. We have spent 140 euros and we have left hungry. Money does not matter if we eat well. It has hurt me more for them than for me. The dishes were good.\n",

The account did not amount to more than ‚Ç¨ 40 per person and above we had a discount so it went all round.The dishes were spectacularly good, an unbeatable presentation and a superior flavor. Each bite was a new experience, which made you taste and enjoy infinitely each piece that you had in your mouth.We also want to extend this review of ***** to Pauline, the waitress who attended us, which was 10 throughout the night. Pleasant, friendly, attentive, and always with some recommendations on food and dessert, that if it were not for her maybe dinner would not have been so good. \"Greetings from Almeria;)\"We hope to be able to return to Barcelona and repeat this magnificent experience.\n",

The place, with a modern and beautiful decoration, is too lonely, there is a lack of diners and a lack of atmosphere but looking at it positively, that gives a calm and intimacy to the appointment that in our case was very positive because we were a group of 8. At the end, we went up to have a drink on the terrace. The view is spectacular and the cocktails extraordinary, but the area is narrow and somewhat overwhelming. A bit forced in some corners but, despite that, it is worth it. Totally recommendable\n",

      "Extraordinary experience from the moment you enter until you leave the restaurant. It had been a while since we had been able to enjoy a similar experience and I suppose that in part that helped make the experience even better, however, it was not the first restaurants of these characteristics that we visited. When we left, we agreed that without a doubt, the Kitchen of the Torres Brothers was going straight to the first position on our list.Very elegant place, attentive service, they take care of every detail. The fact of having the kitchen in the center allows us to see how the dishes are prepared live, that is, you do not hear any noise and the work in the kitchen is quiet and orderly.We tried 3 different wines during the menu and they were a success, we loved them.As for the menu, perfect, we would not change anything.Ultimately we can only say:Looking forward to seeing you again!\n",

They deserve much more, for the treatment, professionalism and attention of the whole team, very careful and fast service, for the personal warmth of Sergio and Javier who have imprinted on the place a way to make family and at the same time the level of the best international cuisine. We chose the Revoluci√≥n tasting menu option with wine pairing; a pass! We will be back for sure. Congratulations !!!\n",
      "When you go to the Torres brothers' restaurant and enter the place, its name takes on the most literal meaning. You enter the Torres brothers' kitchen. Good feelings from the first second.

      "A cool experience. The show begins as soon as you enter; At all times they are dependent on you and you on them since they have the kitchen in the center of the restaurant and you can see what they do at all times.

It is definitely worth it.\n",

      "Hemranos Torres KitchenA very elegant and luxurious restaurant with a modern, elegant, but at the same time informal atmosphere. The cooking show is an incomparable show. The food is exquisite, each dish is a surprise, even the simplest dishes are combined with exotic seasonings that give them an extraordinary and amazing taste of high quality. My favorite is the sunflower ice cream. I loved it. Very attentive and friendly service that explains each dish (what it contains and how they suggest eating it). If we don't like something on the menu, they change it for something else and also ask about allergies. The Torres Brothers themselves go to the tables and ask all the customers if they liked the dinner. High prices but in accordance with the quality and high level service. A highly recommended site, especially for special events.\n",

      "I loved the place. Suddenly, you discover a little house in a very urban environment and just entering you are filled with warmth. Wide spaces, tables with tablecloths, dim lighting and cleanliness are appreciated. The environment predisposes. The warmth continues with the professionalism of the staff and the detail of Javier Torres to take a photo with me for being my 59th birthday.In the center of the room the professionals are chatting and surely creating new projects.At no time does the smell of cooking arrive.The tableware falls in love. A minimalist presentation, with wooden elements on the base and its symbol printed on a box.The tasting menu was superb. More than one dish was accompanied with ‚Äòbroths‚Äô that enhanced flavor and helped in the tasting and brought freshness. A success to start with several appetizers (they maintained the same background flavor) and a success to end with several sweets (varied, not cloying at all)The crunchy accompanying dishes were exquisite. The dishes followed one another in harmony and each new texture leaves you with a trace of happiness.The cava, wine and liquor were served majestically, with precision and with success in the proposals.A luxury to have been able to go, a luxury to have celebrated my birthday üéÇ in the kitchen of brothers torres\n",

      "One of the places you have to visit sometime in your life, whether you are from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãMadrid or Beijing .... The food is \"God\" level, the treatment of the closest and friendliest you can find, cleanliness, style ... .cozy. One of the things I like the most is the kitchen surrounded by tables, where they prepare your dish in sight and serve it fresh off the stove. The Brothers, Sergio and Javi, two humble guys, full of life, with a desire to do things well and always with a good smile and very concerned that you will return to that \"Ship of Dreams\" recommended in every possible way.\n",

      "My family and I enjoyed my birthday lunch here. This is an unforgettable and best birthday gift! The beautiful and spacious restaurant allows us to feel the first peak as soon as we enter the door. The open central console brings the diners an excellent \"scene experience\". We can feel the chefs carefully and earnestly every dish. Present to us after cooking. The platters are beautifully presented, such as ice cream shortbread on sunflower, almond elderflower, white truffle and onion soup. The selection of ingredients has local characteristics, and the understanding of its source makes us feel more at ease and imaginative. The design of the menu and the order of production are like enjoying a concert, with a fresh and pleasant rhythm, and climaxes one after another. The restaurant's wine selection is very international and open-minded, which is relatively rare in high-end restaurants in Catalonia. It also makes the flavor of a full set of more than a dozen wines more compatible with each dish. Chef Torres communicated and chatted with the guests at each table, and also specially sent me birthday wishes. At that moment, I was moved and happy! In the end, there was warm applause from the audience to the respected chef team, which pushed the lunch to another peak, which is rare in other restaurants. All the guests left as contentedly as we did, and look forward to the next visit!\n",

      "Two stars sooo deserved !!Sublime gastronomic experience with a show of flavors and textures. Illusion Menu with snacks and 16 dishes + another extra that was kindly offered to taste.Spacious but very warm place at the same time. In the center the kitchen where you can observe at all times how all the magic happens. It is impressive how well everything is synchronized.In addition, the treatment and first-class service as it could not be otherwise in a place like this, although it does not always happen, even one of the Torres brothers came to exchange impressions of some of the dishes.Very attentive at all times, with clear and precise explanations of the dishes and the corresponding wine to pair with.Among the dishes to highlight although all were delicious:* Tuna roe praline* Squid cured with caviar, poultry consomm√© and caviar* Onion from sources, cured parmesan cheese and uncinatum truffles* Cod and its essence with crystal piquillo pepper* Royale quail breast, corn, plums and fig leafFor lovers of haute cuisine it is a MUST !!\n",

      "Very good experience in the Torres brothers. Good menu, good service, spectacular venue and great personal treatment. In any case, we lacked a little more punch / surprise but it is a totally personal opinion. They will have to work hard to keep 2 * and opt for 3 *. In any case, it is worth the experience. Top 5/10 of Barcelona.\n",
      "Spectacular, recommended experience\n",
      "A wonderful experience\n",

      "We went to celebrate my mother's birthday and we were delighted. Because of the magic of the place, the transparency in what they do with a completely open kitchen, the attention of the staff and their impeccable professionalism, etc. A menu worthy of 2 and even 3 stars and Javier Torres, who was the brother who was when we went, a humble, dedicated person, who treated us wonderfully and made us live an unforgettable comprehensive experience. We will be back!\n",
      "It is quite a show, the perfect tasting menu, the presentation of the dishes a work of art, the service with a perfect choreography,Highly recommended\n",
      "Excellent, a great experience.Unbeatable treatment of the whole team and especially of the Torres brothers. A pass !!!\n",
      "The place is very nice, with the central kitchen in the middle of the room is spectacular. The service is very good (counting only 21 guests at lunch on a Tuesday). The menu is very good except for some fluffy dish.\n",
      "We have gone today to celebrate the 70th birthday of my father and my aunt and the truth is that it has been a great experience.The Earth menu (‚Ç¨ 155) was sensational and the truth is that the 16 dishes were all, absolutely all, delicious!The place, an old factory or warehouse is remodeled with great taste and very elegant decoration. At the end of the meal, if you ask, they make you a small route through the seven kitchens, cellar and creative office of the Torres Brothers.And they .... LOVERS !!In short, I recommend it 100% and take this opportunity to thank the attention received and ensure that today has been a day that we will always remember.\n",
      "Impressive high-end restaurant. Elegant and perfect attention from cooks and waiters.\n",
      "A fantastic experience, it is worth it.\n",
      "One of the great restaurants in Francesc cambo, as always the Torres brothers preparing their dishes for each client, a wide variety of different food and with a team of chefs differentiated in fish, meat, salads and pastries, local food and very high quality, super Recendable and with winemakers who will help you choose Koldo as a great sommelier.\n",
      "a good tasting experience and with a very good service .. the dishes are all exquisite. maybe you end up a little too full for the amount of dishes they serve you .. highly advisable\n",
      "A unique experience ... the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcooking in the middle of the tables. It's a show ... watch how they work and move. Eat super good Javier Torres very kind ... and attentive\n",
      "Superb local, good attention and excellent cuisine. It meets the expectations of a restaurant of this level\n",
      "Having always been passionate about and attracted to this fascinating universe of the world of gastronomy, I had always promised myself that the first Michelin-starred restaurant that I would do would not be selected for the price but rather for what it offers. : its history, its universe, its products ... my choice therefore turned, after several searches, on Cocina Hermanos Torres.I will spare you the long list of superlatives that crossed my mind at the end of the meal, nor will I share with you all the photos of the dishes and the room because it would be a shame to spoil the surprise. There are experiences worth having than being told, I just had one of the best nights of my life. La Cocina Hermanos Torres is the epitome of what human beings of extraordinary creativity can bring you to experience with the best products.A big thank you to this establishment for the moment I had the opportunity to experience last night.\n",
      "Tremendous. I liked that the menu consists of normal dishes but very well prepared. All exquisite and without spherification;)\n",
      "Incredible place. Fantastic serviceTasting menu very copious and daring. You have to like everything ... if you're not one of those ... bad choice. But if you are like me, you will enjoy as a Dwarf.\n",
      "What to say, maximum wonder, a bacchanal of eating and drinking, I did the long tasting with pairing because as you go you have to enjoy.\n",
      "Amazing. A super recommended Lluc. Unbeatable serving. Food of gods.\n",
      "I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because they have only just started and they still have filming and fine-tuning several points and having gone the first week that they opened is the most normal. Regarding the tasting menu, spectacular, they take us around their world, a circle that begins with bread and Linares oil and ends in a Jewel for the diner. And finally, the protagonists, the Torres brothers, little can be added that is not known, they emanate passion for what they do and complicity with the diner, I will only put a but, they left without saying goodbye !! I wish you great success!\n",
      "Fantastic experience. We have loved the menu. We will be back for sure! Highly recommended!\n",
      "A good experience.We have taken the \"Aromas\" menu, all very tasty dishes. We have loved the well elaborated traditional products, such as suckling pig, sea bass, cod ...The awesome bread!The staff generally friendly, but the waitress who explained the dishes lacks empathy. If you ask for something that has just been explained, it is difficult to repeat it. You know the lesson and even there. A shameThe minutes arrived when we were going for the sixth course.Also a pity that the Torres brothers are not there, I follow them on TV and they seem very cordial. A little closer treatment would come very well.Finally I found it very bad taste to be charged for a glass of water. In a menu of that price, it does not apply ..... Nor charge ‚Ç¨ 4.50 for each coffee.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant, one of the best I've visited. Near treatment, incredible dishes and techniques. We will repeat without a doubt!\n",
      "Without a doubt, on the podium of the best restaurants in Barcelona ... Perhaps at the top. A Roots Menu in which none of the 21 dishes clashes, with a consistency in the taste approach between them and of absolute exaltation of the product.Very good roll is transmitted in the room, with a direct dialogue between kitchens and diners, perfectly coordinated and with an unprecedented reach and proximity in other high cuisine restaurants, more typical of the tapas bar of a lifetime in which one feels like at home.\n",
      "Unique place and worth every euro it costs.From the welcome to the farewell no detail escapes the service that moves like a choreography.Food of such an exquisite and elaborate level without becoming esoterically complex. The art of the presentation of the dishes is aligned with the flavors, textures and smells that are perceived when tasting themWe will be back.\n",
      "We have gone to celebrate my partner's birthday. The excellent treatment and the spectacular food. There was Javier, one of the brothers, who came to greet each of the tables. Very kind, with us we even took a picture.\n",
      "Excellence and quality Wonder of dishes with a magnificent product quality, attention, training and closeness. Exquisite onion soup, or piglet. Constant surprises and a way to involve and make the client participate in the experience. Better with pairing, which dominate admirably.\n",
      "Everything perfect, very attentive, we can not wait to go back. We have a long menu and pairings and the experience was unbeatable. All very friendly, I loved the wines and the Sumellier. When we sat Sergio Torres came to greet us without waiting for a moment. Thank you very much to all!\n",
      "Exceptional. The short menu is more than enough to enjoy a trip with powerful but close tastes, remembering mountains, forests and sea. Dishes without stridency, round in presentation and taste. The service at the level of food. They were interested in the result of each dish, they worried about leaving us the best possible memory in each service and always friendly and receptive. Please, if you are going to try the degreasing menu let yourself go, accept each dish as it was created and try not to bring prejudices, textures or smells to the table. Remember that it is an experience and as such the best, although nobody is obliged, is to enjoy it as its author thought when creating it. Upon learning that I was celebrating my birthday they had a detail by adding a candle to the closing of the menu.It has been a pleasure. We will be back.\n",
      "Sensational !!! And I am left with many adjectives that define as for yesterday, lunch, we enjoyed this wonderful restaurant.On the occasion of the celebration of our 47th Wedding Anniversary, with my family 6 adults and 1 baby of 1 year just turned.Just by crossing the entrance you can see that they have taken care of the decoration to the smallest detail as well as the lighting.The atmosphere is serene and relaxed, it must be said that both Sergio and Javier received us as soon as we arrived, giving a proven example of their sympathy, proximity to the diner, as well as their experiences in the different dishes that they present to which of them more exquisite.Very difficult to value only a few.They have achieved their dream of placing the tables around the large open kitchen, a fundamental part of the complex.Many successes in your new journey and surely you have already done it.Also thank the family photo with Sergio and Javier, impeccable.\n",
      "Large and modern room. Very attentive staff and the Torres brothers greet each other as they sit at the table and ask how it went at the end, a detail with the place full. Spectacular menu, well presented, does not leave you indifferent. Exceptional lunches in times of pandemic.\n",
      "I have loved the experience, it is brutal !!!! I could not say which dishes are the best, everything is wonderful of flavors, the great treatment, Javier was there and what to say about his sympathy, all very professional, we have enjoyed a lot.thanks to all the team\n",
      "Awesome. Excellent service and high quality wine selection.\n",

      "very good all price a little expensive\n",
      "Two well-deserved michelin stars. Excellent menu and service. Thank you so much\n",
      "In general the food is good although I expected more from their dishes, there are dishes such as salmon, ravioli and duck breast that for my taste I expected more. What I liked the most is being able to see how the plates are plated since you can hardly ever see the work that this entails. Sergio and Javier's attention to their guests is exquisite and that of the staff as well.\n",
      "Brutal, for its quality of products and professionalism of the staff, without a doubt a great success and daily effort of the brothers. They are good people and it is reflected in the work. We hope you have a very long success.\n",
      "Incredible place, as an old ship is transformed into this fantastic restaurant..very good food and the proximity of the chefs !!!\n",
      "Awesome tasting menu, super attentive service and the incredible and very friendly Torres brothers\n",
      "Spectacular! We have gone for our wedding anniversary my wife and I and we loved it. The restaurant is very different from the previous one they had (two skies), it is modern but it also has an open kitchen. The waiters are very friendly and attentive. And the food was incredible, we went for the Earth menu (the most complete) with 20 dishes. They are small but in the end we go round with so much food. Each dish comes with its set of cutlery and container as you can expect in a 2-star restaurant. A gem for food lovers. Cherry on top, there were the 2 brothers and we were able to take a picture and talk a little with them üëå\n",
      "Very good dining experience. A 10 for Torres brothers and team.\n",
      "Traditional cuisine taken to the maximum expression.Unbeatable service.Best main: Mushrooms with beans from Sant Pau. Best dessert: Frozen hazelnut cloud.\n",
      "Actually 6 stars! Wow what an experience.\n",
      "Great experience in the new space of the Torres brothers in Barcelona. The visit is a must for foodies. Its tasting menu does not leave you indifferent.\n",
      "Taste guarantee with modern cuisine dishes that takes us to traditional flavors such as its onion soup or its squid with poultry soup\n",
      "Everything is spectacular if you have to go sometime or more\n",
      "Probably Barcelona needed this \"back to basics\". A tribute to the product kitchen (proximity), with a TOP3 presentation in the city, and a peninsular pairing based on the triangle Galicia - Catalonia - brutal Andalusia. If we add to that the presence and warmth ofSergio and Javier, and a team at the height of their 2 *, the result is national\n",
      "The exquisite food is unbeatable.It's worth the money invested.\n",
      "What to say, a past and an experience! Marvelous!\n",
      "Wonder of experience. A gastronomic adventure very interesting and worth recommending. The Torre brothers are a sure hit.\n",
      "The food is good, but they are sooooo slow that it takes away your hunger between courses. We also ordered some cocktails and they didn't bring them until we had two plates eaten dry ... And there were only 4 tables occupied! I don't even want to think about a day that is full.\n",
      "Totally recommendable. Very interesting and fun fusion food. Unbeatable, friendly and very attentive service.\n",
      "A super cool place. The design and style of the site seems very cool and interesting.The food is a fusion of Mexican food with Asian touches. The taste is just as good as the presentation.100% recommendable!\n",
      "The cocktails are very good, the nachos do not quite understand burrata, truffle, pesto in some nachos ... I was not bad but I did not finish, the quesadillas the same, the best the octopus. Very good service\n",
      "It is a very quiet and comfortable place. The attention was really good, they are all very nice and the drinks were deliciousüòç\n",
      "In general, everything is excellent: the treatment, the atmosphere, the value for money, the quantity of the food, its quality, its cocktails ... but its nachos are out of the ordinary: simply wonderful, the best I've ever had. in my life. Impressive.\n",
      "I got to know the place through a raffle they made, it was so enchanted. Super cozy, the nachos were delicious (I think the best I've ever had) and you can't leave without trying the mango margaritas they are totally insane. I will not hesitate to return and recommend you guys, I loved the very friendly treatment ..\n",
      "It is a very charming place with a very good atmosphere. The correct service, very good, impeccable treatment.And the consumption well presented, prepared and very good.I repeat for sure.Thanks\n",
      "A Mexican fusion place, very rich and with different flavors.We had tacos and nachos to share and we liked all the flavors a lot.Nachos: we have pekin and flank steak, both very tasty.Tacos: Juanita Lapiedra, Torrente, Japanese raw and Norwegian. Very rich and different flavors.I put 4 stars because the nachos were not made from traditional tortillas and I think that could make a big difference :)We also tried the edamames that were very rich (with a touch of spice) and the margaritas very top because they have different flavors !!For dessert the coulant was very rich and we tried the ‚Äúnot what it seems‚Äù which is also worth it.\n",
      "The best nachos in Barcelona! The place is very well decorated and the attention of the staff is very close and friendly.To drink a michelada with Coronita and to eat a corvina ceviche that although at first you see a small dish is very rich and of perfect quantity.Then came the nachos ...... SPECTACULAR! With cheese and truffle sauce and duck meat.Some shrimp tacos and others of meat that if they had good flavor was not something so striking (even savoring the nachos)For dessert, he offered us a surprise off the menu ... it was very tasty and I will not reveal the flavors üòÖ. We will be back!Quality: 9/10Price: 8/10Local: 9/10Service: 10/10\n",
      "If you want to go for some good nachos, this is the right place.If you want a ‚Äúnot everything is what it seems‚Äù dessert, then this is the place too.The attention of the boys was EXCELLENT, attentive in every detail.Thanks for the unexpected ending ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n",
      "It is a very cool place that you will not get to if no one recommends it.It is near the Cale Blai.The cocktails are amazing and you eat very well.Good atmosphere and ideal to go as a couple or in a group.It's really worth it;)\n",
      "Few are the times where a surprise is complete. When a restaurant exploits your expectations, with a more than great service, an environment in a town that invites you to stay and a meal and cocktails that challenge your culinary knowledge and your expectations, you know that you are in the right place!Very striking! From the outside, @sasha with her extraordinary Flair invites to come in and meet. An inespitable environment. A modest medalist cabsula and at the same time retro. Something that was very special for me and reminded me of \"home\".1. The serviceConcen the product! It is something that is worth gold and jo is something that can be said of all the localities. As a customer, I want them to sell me the best of the best and for this you have to know the product and do not do it, you have to know it! And tadaaaaaa did it. From the smallest detail to the end, no doubt was left open. Attentive! A very high quality service that left me surprised and more than that happy.2. The cocktailsSurprise number one my cocktail, its presentation and its flavor are indescribable. Something is clear, the kitchen is one thing and it can serve you the best of the century, but if the cocktail is bad, say goodbye to the night. And here one after the other just perfection. Nothing more and nothing less. Just a perfect balance that went very well with the plates ordered.3. The foodIt was a shock but one of the most positive possible. One more time. Expectations can deceive you. But what happiness to see and be able to try this. I thought I knew more about Mexican cuisine and maybe just try something Mexican. Surprise mine to see this at this level!Mexican fucion kitchen was as I best described it.Let's take it apart a bit so that they understand meBy far my favorite dish of the night was #nachos.Fresh, crunchy, accompanied with a light #kimchi sauce which added a slight sour-spice to the tacos and a great Asian flavor, a slightly truffle cream which kissed the nachos and finally ripened duck. How I bring out this flavor so well balanced between the many structures and flavors in the mouth. It was a party in my mouth! Simply wow! There are few times that I say it but definitely by far the best I have tried. Each dish served, a pleasant and beautiful tribute to one of the most beautiful cultures of our Latin America, Mexico. Is it a place you should go? Absolutely! Certainly some!Go ahead now is your tourno. Time to try try and test\n",
      "M, I liked it much more than now the truth, gins are very small !!!!!!\n",
      "We ran into it by chance and I said, \"Let's try it? It looks good!\" my intuition was right üëåü§≠Delicious typical Mexican dishes with signature touches.Not too much quantity but a lot of quality. 100% recommended.\n",

      "We loved the place, the treatment and the food!\n",

      "Quality food and excellent service in a beautiful bar-restaurant in the Poble sec area. The waiter who served us explained each of the dishes and always greeted us with a smile (if memory serves us, her name was Annes, sorry if it's misspelled).Recommended place if you are a lover of tartare and ceviches. For dessert we recommend the trapantojo. And if you like cocktails, this is your place.As a downside I would say that the prices are a bit high but they still get the 5 stars because they deserve it.\n",

      "Delicious Catracha food! Excellent service. I really liked the care taken in the covid prevention measures, everything was very clean, even the toilets.

      "hearty food at the right price, personalvery attentive and professional.having the patience to explain to me what he did not know about the dishes and even the time it takes to serve each one because they make them at the moment, because I am not Honduran.Note that contrary to what happens with other Central American restaurants, you do not have to put up with people at the bar or door talking loudly for having drunk too muchnor the loud and strident music.the people who went were able to taste the food and talk calmly\n",
      "Authentic Honduran food, with the same flavors from there, abundant dishes. I was with my partner, who is Honduran, and eating made her move to her country. Some day, I think they make Mexican food too. great service. We will repeat to prove everything\n",
      "We went because it was recommended to us, so we went with good expectations, but it didn't seem like anything to write home about.

      "Restaurant with very good quality, and reasonable price for being Barcelona. Very good deal, and fast service. Highlights include bravas, fried snout and seafood.\n",
      "An institution for the locals. Delicious food at affordable prices. Unfortunately, the service is not up to the mark, the waiters are completely unfriendly, do not smile and just behave rudely. As if we owe money. I really hope that the owners are not indifferent to this.\n",
      "Good product quality and more than reasonable price. The only problem is that they always have the terrace at full capacity, the service is very fast and leaves much to be desired. Still, it is a good option if you are in the neighborhood.\n",
      "I cannot understand the reviews for this restaurant bar. Lunch menu 11'75 if you want two seconds (all the options were not available anymore) you pay a supplement of 2'50. Meager rations. The salmorejo plate had barely any bottom, and it did not have the ham and egg mince. If you order wine, they do not leave the bottle on the table, only two glasses enter even after paying the supplement. The paella is just and scarce. On another occasion we ordered tapas and we did not find it something remarkable either. The treatment of the staff is correct, although there is a waiter who serves with the mask under his nose and they do not stop arguing.\n",
      "All super good super attentive we will return üëç\n",
      "A place of reference. For lunch it has a short but interesting menu. And for great tapas. Good terrace. The professional service. And Catalan is spoken!\n",
      "Very good treatment and very good service, we were delighted with the attention received and with the quality of the dishes. It was all very good and the price was adequate. We will repeat without a doubt!\n",
      "The ham is very good .. for the bread with tomato they use the baguett that is 60 cents, and they charge you 1.60 for that price they could perfectly put a glass bread .. The hard and chewy Galician octopus I wonder if the cook tastes his dishes ..\n",
      "Good service, very tasty food, decent prices.The blond curly waitress was friendly and efficient.Schnapps on the house.We'd love to come back;)Thank you for the lovely evening\n",

      "Contrary to previous reviews, the waitress was nice, courteous and efficient. The food was very good. Price performance ratio okay\n",
      "Excellent Galician dishes. They took great care of us.\n",
      "The waitress's attention (blonde with curly hair) is lousy, arrogant, rude and pays zero attention to ensuring that everything is to your liking. If you want to enjoy good service and food, this is not the place. The good evaluations of this place are for the food, which without being very good is correct and very little to reproach it. The star is for the general impression of the stay, that when you come and with all your good manners and desire to have a good time eating, you leave in a bad mood and disappointed. To tell a customer who does not know how the dishes should come out is to go overboard, I think I know more about Spanish gastronomy and good manners for sure. In short, they have to take it into account, although I doubt that they care since tourists come and go and they will have clients, although it is not their merit.\n",
      "I love this restaurant.Delicious pop, nice terrace.\n",
      "Good place and good food, but yesterday dinner waiters were very inattentive and worried only about closing time and cleaning up the terrace. Much insistence from 10:30 pm on whether they could remove glasses and plates from the table that were not yet finished. In short, they did not let us have dinner in peace, nor did they inform us before we sat down that they intended to close at 11pm (when it is allowed until 1am).A good place of a lifetime, if left in the hands of unwilling and incompetent waiters, it can lose customers. At the moment he has already lost 4. A shame\n",

Obligatory stop if you go through the area\n",
      "The lousy customer treatment at least one of the blonde waitresses with curly hair, you ask her for something and you're not done yet, she leaves. You ask that your ear be done WELL and they bring you preheated, and you ask them to do more and it begins to say that it has to be bathed in oil that way. Well, I tell you one thing, I work in restaurants in Madrid and if they ask you well, check it out or if it takes twice and you don't make excuses ‚Äúyes, gelatin‚Äù ‚Äúyes, it's Galician style‚Äù. It seems that he can get to argue with you. It is better not to ask for beer with lemon because it is pure lemon! Alioli, my goodness, is another matter. It is mayonnaise with garlic powder and it costs 1.50 euros, AWESOME !!! That aioli has to come with cuttlefish! Anyway! We will not return and do not recommend it.\n",

      "The food is very good, the price is not cheap, but it could be worth it. What is not worth it is to put up with the unpleasant and rude treatment of one of the waitresses, always the same person. I have gone several times since I live very close, but everything has a limit and the lack of education and the tone so completely out of place and rude marks a point and end for me. I am not going back, I suppose they will not care since they are always full, but they should consider whether treating clients like this is the most successful policy\n",

Both the service, quality and taste are good, but the price is high. The appetizer is the size of a single tapas house, but the price is about 2-3 times (10-15 euros). However, since they ate full and came out for 60 euros, it doesn't seem to be very expensive.\n",

      "The restaurant overlooking the shopping center / old bullring \"Las Arenas\" is a delight. For the quality and service they offer, the price is not bad. It's to go on special occasions. My case was to go on the occasion of Mother's Day. That yes, we went with my in-laws that are more of quantity than of fine and clear palate, it was a bit far from his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeating \"well\". But for those who want to taste the food with all the senses and appreciate the difference, they will enjoy it. Also, although the appetizers and salads are minimalist, you are not hungry. From main we ordered a rice with prawns and crayfish. We are not hungry. They also offer you different very rich breads and pastries with coffee. I loved the detail of the chocolate with the design of the Puig i Cadafalch flower. I thought it was excellent. In the photos is the tuna salad, the pastries with coffee and a spectacular dessert piece \"pajamas\" with mango, extra-large blackberries and ice cream.\n",

      "Very good\n",
      "Some dishes are very good, along with some other mediocre ones. If you're lucky, it's all incredible. Too bad you can only make menu tasting for your entire table even if you go with teens of those who do not like anything. I do not understand the little empathy. If we change this we would go much more often.\n",

      "We were a group of friends. We chose the menu of the day, ‚Ç¨ 22 without drink or coffee. Everything I ate was delicious. Very friendly and attentive waitresses. As a weak point I can say that they do not have suitable knives for cutting meat. Incredible! In the end we pay about ‚Ç¨ 30 per person.\n",
      "The restaurant is luxurious and the service is good. We made seafood paella, but the taste was too strong and it was not delicious. The price is also high. I do not follow.\n",
      "It is very delicious. The food I ate was octopus and paella. It is a good place to go and taste it by all means.\n",
      "We visited with 3 people today, and the service of the staff here was very good. There was a male staff and a female staff who tied their hair together.

      "Frankly the \"expensive\" side of the table is unwarranted. For a main course, a dessert 1 / 2l of water and a good glass of wine, I have it for 34 ‚Ç¨. Considering the quality of the food it is not very expensive.I have always eaten very well in this restaurant where the staff make the effort to speak to you a little in French.There are also 2 small appetizers on offer and I am currently enjoying 3 delicious cupcakes which pleasantly punctuate my dinner.

The service is very professional, very detailed attention is received at all times. I was disappointed to make the trip to the restaurant to try the Executive Menu, the cheapest one advertised on the restaurant's website, and when we asked for it, they told us that it was not available during the month of August. It seemed wrong to see that other visitors came with the same claim and to know that 19 days of the month of August have passed without doing anything about it.\n",

      "I was there on a weekday and ordered the lunch menu which consists of snacks, and then first, second and dessert to choose from between 4-5 options each.Although I expected it as it is a restaurant with a star, I was pleasantly surprised by the high level of the cuisine. The dishes were delicious, all of them, cooked with care, quality and imagination.The menu includes water, bread service and a glass of wine for almost ‚Ç¨ 50. It is definitely worth it.\n",

      "Michelin star restaurant with affordable menu. Everything was good. Great service. The quantities are fine, except for the desserts, which are a little scarce.\n",
      "Feel the kind of atmosphere less than a star. There are obviously cloakroom door design and planning, but they did not ask us not to hang clothes, to see the back of local guests, also draped the jacket over the back.The restaurant is the open kitchen, but basically only see the head chef, can not see how their dishes.Former pork dish is labeled with a pan of cooking pancakes, made with a number of mushrooms. Another appetizer is also under the second sub-pad biscuit, top onions, mushrooms as well as eel dishes, rich taste, delicious eel.Main course is the Iberian pork roll. Made of a single piece of Iberian pig roast way inside similar degree of nine points cooked cooked, roasted with butter, then wrapped inside apricot taste is similar to beef, very tasty! Sweet and sour sauce partial system, but will not be too acid.Dessert is the powdered green tea with fruit sauce, this road special feeling Michelin restaurant, green tea sauce taste very air, but there are green tea taste, an inlet instantly disappear taste worth pondering.Tea with a small dessert platter is also very good, not too sweet, with tea and coffee for the best.\n",
      "We made the lunch menu for 42 euros. Excellent value for money. Highly recommended. Cozy atmosphere and perfect service\n",
      "It was good to be able to experience Michelin 1 star at good price. The lunch price is really reasonable. It was a price that included wine and water (about ‚Ç¨ 39 per person). Dessert presents the sweetness of the strongest. But personally, main dish thinks that meat dish is better than fish dish.\n",
      "Magnificent, to enjoyGood product, good food, good service, traditional dishes some reinvented others with grandma's recipe but all with high quality ingredients.Good service without the rigidity of other places giving it a more relaxed and family atmosphere.Do not dalir garlic without eating meat cannelloni, very good.\n",

      "Very elegant restaurant with a good tasting menu very complete. Friendly and attentive service.The only thing to say is that a dish that was accompanied, according to the letter, by M√∫rgoles, when they brought us the dish was accompanied by Rossinyol. They didn‚Äôt tell us and we had to ask. For the rest, all right !!\n",

      "Menu for ‚Ç¨ 45, starter, main course and dessert to choose, unlimited water and wine to choose between white or red, filling the glass during the meal.

      "People who know what they are doing. Much craft and quality. Very good experience.\n",

      "Great service. Best food. Acgedor\n",
      "An unforgettable culinary experience. Attention, product, service, kitchen of 10.\n",
      "A few days ago, we went with my wife for the first time to this restaurant, about which we had heard very good comments. We ordered the lunch menu and frankly it was disappointing. A tomato tartare with no grace, a correct second but not surprising. The desserts possibly the best. The house red wine was not to my liking either. For that price, there are much better alternatives, for example those in Berasategui that have a cheaper menu with a better offer. I do not think I will go back and I would not recommend it.\n",
      "Delicious and caring. A candle cake is specially prepared for us on the anniversary, to warm our hearts! Great!\n",
      "Let's see ... Menu of gastronomic experience, a glass of cava and a few aperitifs, dp three plates: beef cannelloni with foie (brutal), rap with chutney (correct), beef steak with foie (al Lucinant) ... But the dessert ... Chocolate Saturn, pasta bags made of cream ... And with coffee ... more: -d\n",
      "Honestly, the quality of the kitchen is not up to the price, they spend a lot with the bill, and even charge the cutlery, something that really can not be done (although many locals do). For the price you are going to pay, there are many restaurants in Barcelona where you will eat better, and also for a lower price you have them kicked. The truth is not worth it\n",

      "Excellent place, good food and first class attention I recommend.\n",
      "There are truly restaurants that don‚Äôt need a Michelin (nor does it need to) to delight their diners. For days I could not find a restaurant (some with a star) with such an excellent treatment of the product and also with its customers. They surprise you with dishes with combinations of tastes without these altering the product, on the contrary, they enhance it.Good wine list and a homemade bread that is a joy for those of us who are \"panarres\".We did the tasting menu (a 10 without palliatives) and the next day I will taste their famous cannelloni.Also just arriving they already had the pillows I had ordered ready for a spine problem. A 10 also for his treatment.\n",
      "A culinary experience at the hands of professionals of the level, and a perfect coffee, the icing on the cake to a good meal.\n",
      "You can tell that the knowledge of the restaurant comes from one of the best schools in Europe. Good treatment and professionalism.\n",
      "Fantastic food topped off by horrible coffee.Too bad to have a bad taste in my mouth\n",
      "Everything perfect, the only thing that failed was the coffee\n",
      "Delicious tasting menu. The only downside is that for my taste the dishes were served too quickly, without respecting the time between dishes. As a suggestion, the experience would improve if we could have the menu in front of us when eating, since many times after the second bite you no longer remember the ingredients of the dish (especially when several dishes are served at the same time)\n",

The service in the restaurant is very friendly and attentive. It is my pleasure to recommend this wonderful restaurant to visit and will gladly return here many more times. Would recommend for a romantic dinner. Dinner for a small company. And keep up the good work!Visited here again in 2021 in the summer and only a tasting menu is offered for dinner. Still at a high level, service, delicious, but the menu was more interesting in my opinion. I hope, after all these problems, they will return to their previous positions.\n",
      "Great service\n",
      "We were five diners who enjoyed the Tribute menu. All exceptional but both scallops and chocolate dessert, simply: something else. The impeccable service and the well-balanced wine list, without stridency and perfectly accompanies this classic Barcelona.\n",

The slow desserts as I say but delicious. I guess the good is made to wait. I speak of the tasting menu\n",
      "Nice place. Excellent food and very friendly and professional treatment. We used the \"gastronomic experience\" that they had given us and that is bought on their website and we were delighted.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure to go to dinner. Everything was super good. Great service .and we will be back\n",
      "Rooftop bar on the 9th floor with a wonderful view and comfortable seats and loungers. Small pool to relax in.I can't judge the food, we \"only\" had several cocktails. These are very expensive and the selection is not particularly large. If you lie by the pool, the drinks are unfortunately only served in plastic cups, which is not appropriate for the price. There are certainly better tastes in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbut the overall package is still good.\n",
      "So we leave the prices out :-) The food was very delicious - service took care of us brilliantly - wonderful atmosphere to be recommended\n",
      "A pleasant place in roof top, we visited it at night but the cocktails (especially the margarita were not up to par)\n",

      "We really wanted to go to this terrace but we got a disappointment due to the service we received, I think due to inexperience and misinterpretation of the language (Spanish). We ordered a series of dishes to share, we explicitly chose without nuts and we commented it because it was due to an allergy; We also got a salad with hazelnuts, which we had to return. We also ordered the beef chop to the point, for three times, and finally it arrived very made and in hot stone, with which the meat was spoiled. We commented, they apologized but we ended up eating the last chop of 59 euros. The rest of the food very well and the place cool. It would improve if they opened the pool area. It is higher and has better views.\n",
      "Seldom eaten so bad. Dry squid, dry octopus and unmotivated service staff. Were there on the basis of good reviews, but cannot share this. Sorry\n",
      "The place is incredible, the views are spectacular and if you arrive on a full moon day, the setting is perfect for a wonderful evening. The sensational food and the sincerely exquisite cocktails, but without a doubt what caught my attention the most was the treatment of Mauro and his team, it could not be more professional and polite. A terrace to return to; o)\n",
      "Rooftop without city viewGood quality food and serviceToo noisy atmosphereNot to renew\n",
      "We went to try the fondue menu which is only available for a few weeks. They have 3 different menus depending on the number of starters or the type of fondue.It is an authentic and high quality experience. The staff is very friendly and helpful, as well as enjoying a luxurious terrace.The quantities are large, so with a starter and fondue it is more than enough.They also have a menu to order other dishes. Drinks are quite expensive.\n",
      "A friend and I came here and how nice. The cameros and the food was very good, especially Lugigi and Mauro, they are very attentive and friendly.The space is very nice too!______A friend and I came here and how amazing!

      "Good cocktails and a very good salmorejo salad.On the terrace it can be very pleasant to avoid the heat üò¨\n",
      "The place is at the GL The One hotel, and that in a place like this one this type of practice is carried out seems unfortunate to me. We went to dinner and had a drink, we ordered a Luis Ca√±as (38 ‚Ç¨ VAT inc.) Hummus, it was cold from the fridge, it was not fresh, then the hamburger came, which was not bad, but it was salty, my partner asked for Tataki and he couldn't. To finish, they kindly offered him a dessert that was fine \"Pan con chocolate\", then we ordered a Margarita and a GTonic. When asking for the bill they charge us everything + total VAT that we paid and we commented on it to the waiter but he said that the VAT was always charged and I told him then in the Menu DO NOT PUT VAT INCLUDED, When later you charge the VAT again, it seems very ugly that everyone is fooled like that because it sure was done with all the tables, we would not return. Attention was fine, somewhat slow but fine.\n",
      "What can you say: Best weather, best rooftop = PERFECT! Cool drinks, great food. MUST GO !!!\n",
      "Very good service\n",
      "The terrace is spectacular and cozy, and also offers incredible views of the city and free WiFi. In the end you can see the Holy Family clearly.I do not put 5 stars because the service did not seem right. We had to go in to say that they brought the letter and also to ask for the command. The waiters were chatting after the bar.Finally, I can understand that they charge you 8 euros for a beer, for the category of the hotel and the views, but not that they bring a mini lid with 5 olives for a group of 4 people. On other occasions they have put me the same and I was alone. Poor attention\n",

      "Overly expensive terrace, a real shame. ‚Ç¨ 21 gintonic and ‚Ç¨ 12 glass of wine served in plastic !! A scam in the middle of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãonly suitable for guiris üò™ when we told them that it seemed very expensive, they told us it was a 5 * GL, in Barcelona there are several and the wine glasses go between ‚Ç¨ 6 and ‚Ç¨ 8 and the gintonics between ‚Ç¨ 12 and ‚Ç¨ 15; ‚Ç¨ 21 had never seen him in front of any monument in any tourist city.To be a 5 * GL, there are virtually no views, young staff without much experience; the music was correct but the place does not give tranquility because there is bad soundproofing and you can hear the whole conversation from the next table.By the way, they close at 12:30 not at 1 as it puts on Google. We will not repeat and notify our friends of this scam.\n",

      "I LOVED!!While it is true that we go to a restaurant for food it is also true that the attention must keep us in harmony and it was what happened to my partner and me, the exquisite food but the attention of the waiters was BRUTAL, almost being attended by your best friend and especially Sonia, an educated and very attentive girl. Thanks for the evening.\n",
      "Rooftop very nice, although the view is partly hidden by the vegetation. The prices are rather high (count between 10 and 16 euros for a cocktail, 12 euros for a pint of beer) but are offset by the frame and the service.\n",

      "Dinner at alkostat, a restaurant attached to the Michelin star Alkimia, which you have little or nothing to envy.A place that is worth visiting both for the facilities (located in a perfectly preserved old building) and for the quality of the food.We started with a grilled oyster with scrambled eggs. Amazing taste. Different. Essential.We continue with some al dente beans with an almost mashed potato and accompanied by butifarra de perol. Apparently simple dish but that shows its great cuisine. Simple and complex at the same time.As meat we have SPECTACULAR gizzards. The pity is that they are part of the ephemeral of the letter. Soft in flavor and texture but with powerful flavor ravioli that give depth to the entire preparation.We finish with a grilled sea bream and its pil pil. Spectacular. The best fish I have had in Barcelona. Perfect point of the fish and great grilled flavor not at all masked with the pil pil. More to more, price adjusted for the size of the portion.Very good experience to which I would only put two buts: extremely expensive wine list (a glass of wine 12 euros) and perhaps a bit slow in service.Price of ‚Ç¨ 115.5 for 3 people. Given the level of cuisine, service and location, it is well worth it.\n",

      "I loved it! We did the tasting menu and everything was delicious. It is a modern Mediterranean cuisine. The staff also very attentive.\n",
      "Spectacular! An unparalleled immersion in the world of seasonal cuisine where each bite surpasses the last. Presentation, atmosphere, treatment, cellar ... all outstanding.\n",
      "An entire gastronomic experience: a seasonal product that is treated in an excellent way, with no fuss or excessive moldiness. Recommended long menu if you want to try several things. If you are a wine lover, be guided by the sommelier, young but knowledgeable about the world of wine, proposing amazing pairings.\n",
      "Highly recommended restaurant. They treat the product delicately with a lot of flavor and combination of flavors and textures. It is a fairly seafood-focused restaurant. The menu we chose was the alchemy menu and super good. The waiters are close but at the same time with a very professional treatment. They have made me feel very comfortable and I have dined in luxury. That does cost a little to find the entrance because it is in an apartment next to the moritz factory. A picturesque touch with a spectacular decoration.\n",
      "Fabulous cocktails, great atmosphere. The waitress Maria Isabel is charming and very attentive, we will return for sure!\n",
      "delicious! But it's a little greasy.I feel like I'm feeling heavy on my stomach.The course was quite large even for those with few dishes, and I felt that it was enough for those with few dishes unless they were very big eaters.I tried to dress casually, but it was okay to wear casual clothes.\n",
      "Wonderful place, with prices very in line with the quality, perfect service, we will definitely return\n",
      "Good high-flying cuisine with a spectacular, professional and attentive service. Good masters working in the kitchen and an extensive and quite full wine list from the country. The tasting menu of ‚Ç¨ 168 is amazing and with frequent changes so that it is not monotonous in time, the one I enjoyed had a very important weight the fish, which is to be appreciated. Reservations are required in order to enjoy this gastronomic pleasure. Enjoy and enjoy.\n",
      "A great atmosphere and excellent staff. The food of a high quality with very good elaborations. The chef's touches are noticeable.I recommend not going to dinner since even if it is a tasting menu, the dishes are relatively abundant.To repeat!\n",
      "Immediately after lunch was open, I went without a reservation. Push the door phone at the entrance, put in, crawl in, and ascend the stairs you will see the Aqua Blue object. The interior was surprisingly casual.There are course dishes and an √† la carte menu, and the √† la carte menu offers a choice of grilled salmon and 2 lamb dishes. And I got dessert and coffee. Lamb meat was a memorable dish.I would like to have a course meal at dinner this time.\n",
      "Very special traditional and creative experience\n",
      "Tasted the alchemy menu. Excellent. Good rhythm between dishes. Great service.Without a doubt a pleasant experience to repeat.Thank you.\n",
      "When you enter you feel like a labyrinth, you do not know where to turn, nice decoration. The room quite \"cold\", normal waiters, and the food .... well, the only thing I liked was the dessert. What a hobby with having to modify a food so much to make it \"Gourmet\" that it loses the sense of what it was\n",
      "A fabulous space to enjoy the signature cuisine\n",
      "Very happy with the experience. The spectacular atmosphere. Music and decoration. Of the food little to say, very good and amazing. Congratulations to the whole team. From the first to the last dish. Excellent service. Obviously not cheap, but the experience is worth it. He is one of the few who does not charge for water or bread on the menu. I'm sure we'll repeat. We touched a table near the kitchen and enjoyed being able to attend the way we worked.\n",
      "Fantasy. It is better that you do not read any review and protect the surprise. Book and enjoy.\n",

      "Well, correct. For a Michelin star I expected more variety of flavors and textures. Impeccable service.\n",
      "All right and the menu long affordable to star! The place is beautiful, quiet and different. Things that would improve is to put some more meat dish (the lamb was brutal) and we ordered wine tasting and none was Catalan.\n",
      "Restaurant where the typical controversy of the offer of a Michelin star restaurant versus a normal restaurant arises. In the end the doubt after leaving the Alkimia remains the same ... correct food with very fair amounts, very weak desserts (the worst Tiramisu I have ever had) and a service with little spark and sympathy. The design of the premises the best.\n",
      "Excellent everything! From attention to food\n",
      "The best I have ever tasted, incredible attention.\n",
      "Super taste experience in exciting surroundings\n",
      "The originality of an artistJordi Vil√†, Chef at Alkimia, 1 MICHELIN star more than deserved, quite a show to see him work in his open kitchen, wrapped in his creativity, he never ceased to amaze us in each of the eight dishes we tasted, plus the desserts.Highlight the minimalist decoration of the premises and the excellent service of the room staff.Highly recommended!\n",

      "Michelin star worthy restaurant. The idea is full of food and the transfer is enormous. There were many dishes that admired this cooking of this material. When I first went there, it was hard to find the entrance, but the buzzer of the main gate was pressed to confirm the reservation. The entrance to the restaurant also has a unique interior and the inside is also funny with a fish bone shape.\n",

      "Spectacular food, exquisite treatment\n",
      "I didn't find anything special. The loose service, very weak (suffice it to say that my partner put the cutlery on his right and me on my left because the waitress was doing better since serving us from the side was more at hand). The raw material, good, very good, but the conjugation of flavors I did not understand and I saw no harmony in most dishes. I recommend not sitting near the kitchen since the smells are mixed with the dishes. The good sommelier.\n",
      "I have eaten super well and the waiters attentive all, a very nice and particular atmosphere\n",
      "A quite comfortable place, with a careful decoration. We have gone to the whole family to eat and we loved it, we will repeat !!\n",
      "The Catalan cuisine ... let's leave it in abstract Catalan cuisine. If you like Can Roca, Bulli etc., this is the same style. Dishes of large descriptions with tiny amounts ... and more if you go to the tasting menu. More time listening to what it is and how it is eaten, than in what it takes to digest it.\n",
      "Very good selection of beers and tapas and saucers are also very good!\n",
      "Phenomenal a very comfortable place with impeccable service and a kitchen of boca di cardinalethank you very much for these moments\n",

      "I was in this restaurant 3 years ago as a gift for my birthday and it is one of the best gifts they have ever given me :-) I remember that we ordered the tasting menu and it was great to try many different dishes. The dishes are small but there are many so one is more than satisfied in terms of quantities. We even had 3 desserts !! I want to return soon!\n",
      "A great experience for those who love it, the experience of tradition menu dishes, including dishes from other menus. A kitchen of sensations that will last until the next visit. Dishwasher dish with gantxo (except the bricklayer, too intense even x me). The staff, young and attentive, but I recommend that you always have the letter to know where you are going. Very recommendable!\n",
      "I always find something new that I like when I go here\n",
      "A very peculiar place with a very good tasting menu\n",

      "Fan of chef Jordi Vill√†.\n",
      "Delicious food made with local ingredients.\n",
      "We have a Cuban family, we know gastronomy and we went to discover and recall sensations. The food tastes like Cuba, maybe they are not the flavors that you would find in a Cuban house, but more or less, they are Cuban recipes. The Yuca with Cuban mojo makes it too dry and with very little mojo, it would not be bad to let it boil a little more and be more generous with the Cuban mojo.In relation to prices, the ingredients of Cuban dishes are very basic and nowadays easy to find. ‚Ç¨ 8 for a piece of boiled yucca seems excessive to me, and ‚Ç¨ 7 for a plate of cooked white rice, another excess. If it is for the prices, I would not repeat.\n",
      "Everything we tried was very good and the treatment of the staff is great!\n",
      "My favorite Cuban restaurant in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãtypical Cuban food and delicious desserts. The design as if it were in a paladar of old Havana. It is always a pleasure to visit it again.\n",

      "A wonderful, picturesque and very cozy place. From the outside it already catches your attention because it is something peculiar but as soon as you walk through the door you realize that it is a very charming space. The tables are in different spaces. It's great for both groups and a romantic date. The food of 10 and the treatment at the level of the restaurant, simply great ‚ù§Ô∏è\n",
      "Highly recommended. Abundant and very good food.\n",
      "The food is good, but the mojito better if they did a good course to know how to make them.This is a mojito üëá\n",

      "It is a cozy place, the service is quite good. I can't tell if the food is authentic, it's the first time I've tried it, but the truth is that it's good. The menu is not very extensive and it is a bit expensive although the portions are generous, almost everything designed to share.\n",

      "I visited it by chance, and when I saw that I was specialized in Cuban food I wanted to try it right away, and the truth is that it is a very good place to eat. Exquisite food, and at first glance prices may seem high but you have to keep in mind that the portions reach and spare for two people. I really liked the site üëç It is advisable to book before going.\n",
      "Good, right quality price\n",
      "We were able to have lunch with our Golden. Aside from the fact that the dishes were really plentiful and succulent, the treatment of the staff has been exquisite. If all Cubans are like them, it would be worth going there tomorrow to live.\n",

And we just wanted to drink white wine, which I recognized the one they had in the menu but they just did not have left. The treatment of the waiters were correct, polite and attentive.

      "A classic Fresh seafood and good food Not a cheap restaurant\n",
      "When you go to a restaurant, you expect that the treatment is cordial and that the food is good. But the normal thing is to always find either good food but regular service, or good service but not so much the kitchen. Today in many years going to restaurants guided by the reviews of other people, I could not imagine that it was so SPECTACULAR. THIS RESTAURANT IS PERFECT HAS A üíØ HAS IT ALL! Good food, good treatment and familiarity. I want to thank Vicente the waiter for his great work and professionalism. To the very nice chef who kindly posed for a photo and really to the whole team. I was pleasantly surprised and it is clear that in my future trips to Bcn I will not hesitate to return, and of course, to recommend it!\n",
      "Excellent service. Maybe you got a bit stuck transitioning between hot and cold dishes, but the excellent personal attention more than made up for it. As for the price, in principle it may seem expensive. But if you order with a bit of head (the option of half portions is ideal for 2 people, for example), you have an unbeatable value for money in the area.\n",
      "Great restaurant! Clean, comfortable, spacious and standard service! A large assortment of fresh fish and seafood. Dishes for 5 both in quality and quantity. Of the shortcomings of the price. But it's worth it.)\n",
      "Very good fish and seafood, very friendly staff and super good treatment. It is expensive but the quality is worth it, they change the dishes to each plate and white tablecloths. One of the best restaurants in Barcelona without a doubt!\n",
      "Spectacular, very good service and you eat very very well.We will be back\n",
      "A classic follows at a great level.\n",
      "I am used to going to very good restaurants and this is NOT one of them, mediocre product quality, exorbitant price for quality, cooked with very little affection and / or knowledge. We ordered an octopus that was hard as a stone, cut into rough chunks and filled with paprika so you wouldn't notice that it didn't taste like anything. We continue with a badly called hake, rather it was badly made skewer whiting and an estuary seabass that cost us ‚Ç¨ 80 made in slices with burned garlic. Average wine. The best the jelly beans that they put the child. Total ‚Ç¨ 170. Never to return !!\n",
      "It is not necessary to deny the evidence: good raw material, excellent cuisine, impeccable attention, good marine decoration ...... if you want to stay like a gentleman, take your partner, your parents, your friends, your relatives. ...... that yes, that they are to eat little, because as you have a little \"\" take out \"\" ..... when you leave you go to a burguer, because to me modest to understand, they are \"\" pel√≠n \" \"few, quality (that's why you pay), but few.I leave some photos for your analysis.\n",
      "For real lovers of fresh fish and seafood. One of the best restaurants in Barcelona. The price is not cheap, the quality is VERY GOOD\n",
      "Really nice and nice atmosphereSeafood platter is delicious. But the ink paella asked for less salt, but it was too salty ... „Ö†„Ö† salt was chewed.Still, seafood is fresh and friendly, so I recommend you to visit.\n",
      "Very good food and excellent treatment.\n",
      "The product is something that is indisputable, the value for money is the best we have found in a long time. We have returned after a few years and were surprised by the change. How it has been known to adapt a lifelong seafood restaurant to the new current hospitality situation. My congratulations and thank you very much for the treatment received, feeling like in each is something that is not achieved in all restaurants.\n",
      "The restaurant üç¥ has a comfortable environment.The food ü•ò is delicious, the seafood plate ordered in the first round is very good, and then order the seafood plate again after eating. It's a pity that two mussels in this plate of seafood found a peculiar smell, and finally gave up eating.\n",
      "He eats very well, the rice dishes are spectacular, but the price is high.\n",
      "BetterWith excellent service and a menu that takes away your hiccups, you can't ask for more, recommended for those who want to eat very well.\n",
      "Let's see, this during the last 25 years my fourth or fifth visit ... and always in general the memory is very pleasant .... Although perhaps there are buts in this last visit compared to previous ones ...the first is in terms of the relationship between price and quantity. The price of the portion of squid, squid or octopus ... is excessive! Be careful, the quality is excellent and the octopus a feira for me is the best in Spain including Galicia! The perfect squid, tiny and well battered ... the squid ... passable, nothing out of the ordinary. Very good tomato and bonito salad, good in quantity ... but again a bit over priced. The recommendation of three types of tomatoes and Padr√≥n peppers ... rich ... but expensive. Two rice dishes, one type rich seafood paella, and the one with prawns and excellent octopus. Very rich wild fish but be careful! That the price flies‚Ä¶. Without a doubt it is the great specialty ... but adjusting something regarding the amount would be a success. Good desserts, but there are details that a good Galician should polish ... the Santiago cake directly with wine from meus amores ... as in the past ... and it would have been a detail to end up inviting with an orujito ... they are details.In summary ... the quality of the product is very good, especially the fish ... but the price ... more than for locals is intended for tourists, although given the front office the clientele is classic since it does not have a showy front. In my opinion, personal and with respect ... they have been carried away somewhat by the urban change in the area with restaurants clearly focused on tourism with high prices. A good Galician or Catalan product can have a more moderate price‚Ä¶. Very good facilities, with separate rooms and excellent service. My advice: adjust prices and review portions.\n",
      "Delicious food, fresh fish and optimal service. Always worth a visit.\n",

      "Good raw material and good service\n",
      "Nice and cozy restaurant with a very nice terrace. That is, if we had to move the table ourselves because they had it very close to the others with so much space, I do not understand that they are so close together. That is if the staff are very professional and polite from beginning to end of the meal. The food is very rich and well prepared and it tastes very good.\n",
      "PleasantItalian with delicious pasta and very good service. Appetizers, homemade desserts, beers and terrace also excellent. The only uncontrollable bad thing is the terrace near the school that can alter the noise at certain times and the tranquility.\n",
      "The food and the more or less correct place. The treatment is very improvable, they lack a lot of tact. There are usually no people.\n",
      "Italian food placeWe were 4 people, we ordered pizza and Saltimboccas, of course the Apriboca and the Poblenou (this very good) consists of a bread made with stuffed pizza dough accompanied with potatoes or salad.Potatoes are thin cut and crispy on the edgeThe salad is also delicious, it has aubergine, tomato and mushroomsTo drink we ordered a pink Lambrusco.The guy who attended us super friendly and attentive\n",
      "The pizzas are very good, but it is the second time we go and today we have seen that the kitchen staff does not wear a mask !!. We have commented to the waitress and when we went to notify them they have answered that they were vaccinated, they have put a screen in front so that we do not continue to see them. In the times we are living in, we have found a very great lack of education and respect towards people who dare to go to eat at the restaurant. It's a shame, but we won't be back!\n",
      "Flavors that remind you of home, and of \"mamma\" !! . The service is unbeatable, it makes you want to extend your after-dinner. I recommend it to everyone who wants to travel to Italy without leaving Barcelona.\n",
      "Oh my God! How rich and how abundant we ate. That it has gluten-free and rich options is a plus and every celiac should try. Prices according to how abundant you can eat although meals can also be shared. Nice atmosphere and more if you can eat outside. Highly recommended\n",
      "The restaurant is quite attractive and cozy. They have a great variety of food: pizzas, burgers, pasta ...Personally they should think about adding arugula to all meals.In terms of customer service, the commitment and professionalism over the phone should be improved. They should also add staff, as there is only one waitress and the cook. The waitress is very friendly and charming.Regarding hygiene, the Covid security measures are followed, and the toilets are clean and cared for. It is a detail the decoration or the small gestures that make them attract the customer's attention.For my taste, the SALTIMBOCCA CALB√ì is delicious, especially because of the flavor of the pizza dough, but I have lacked ham and I have left over arugula. More than anything because there were many bouquets and little what is the leaf of this type of lettuce.\n",
      "A fantastic dinner for 6 people. Dishes come out at once for everyone and without delay. Very attentive staff, delicious food and they have gluten-free options. Highly recommended üëå\n",

      "Italian restaurant, cozy, with a simple but decisive menu. We tried different pastas and pizzas and everything was very good. The service was very friendly (although they were a bit clueless and they gave us the wrong account twice ...). The room is small and they don't have too many tables, so better to book.\n",
      "A small restaurant .. but you eat very well .. the waiters attentive to every need. We were very pleased to have found this place‚ù§\n",
      "Excellent treatment and really tasty food. Special mention to the Tagliatelle dish in Rag√π de Jabal√≠. I went specifically to try this dish recommended by a friend and I loved it. A ten for Apribocca !!\n",
      "Delicious pizza and gnocchi with 5 cheeses and very kind staff, I will definitely be back!\n",
      "Excellent Italian restaurant (really) in Poblenou. Ideal for gluten-free diets, they are accredited by the celiac association and handle the subject very well. Pizzas, homemade pastas, salads ... To go and repeat !!!!\n",
      "You eat very well. Quality raw material and a wide variety of gluten-free options. It is appreciated!\n",
      "Good Italian restaurant in the area, very nice treatment and above all good food, specifically saltimboca. We will have to go back because we were left with dishes to try !!\n",
      "Very good food! The saltinbocca and the tiramisu were unbeatable. The food arrived on time and everything together, the attention was very warm and everything is very clean. I would repeat!\n",
      "Very tasty food, terrible treatment, 3 stars is average.After 70 minutes they practically kicked us out (and we still had food on our plates) because they had another reservation.If you eat quickly, I recommend it. If you are looking for a place to spend a night with your friends or your partner, well, I do not know.\n",
      "SPECTACULAR GLUTEN FREE KITCHEN FOR CELIACS !!!Right next to the Rambla del Poblenou is this Italian restaurant with an excellent treatment of the product and with a super close and very nice treatment. The starters very good and original, the pizzas, calzones and saltimboca delicious and with an excellent product treatment, although you are full the desserts you can not miss them.\n",
      "I went with a friend to have a drink and a snack and we practically felt thrown out because they told us that ‚Äúit was a restaurant, not a bar‚Äù, nor did we have time to decide if we wanted to eat or not. So, we finished and left.Sorry, the food must be very tasty, but zero tact.\n",
      "Good pizzas and service. Very correct price. Personally I would put more range of beers.\n",
      "Without doubt one of the best and best priced Italian cuisines in all of Barcelona. From appetizers to desserts, passing through first courses and pizzas, without forgetting the excellent wine choices. The restaurant is welcoming and tastefully furnished and has an intimate and quiet internal terrace. The staff are always attentive and helpful.I recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy excellent food a stone's throw from the Poblenou rambla!\n",
      "Authentic Italy. The pizzas are good and they make some kind of sandwiches with pizza dough which are very good. The generous portions, we went rolling. Helpful and very friendly staff.\n",
      "The pizza is wonderful, few pizzas I have eaten and I am going to eat better than this one. Exquisite ravioli, a real wonder. I will repeat without a doubt. 100% recommendable.\n",
      "We had a great time in this restaurant. A very good place to eat Italian. Delicious meals and very friendly staff. Note in restaurants to do in Barcelona.\n",

      "Customer service is the best of the place, followed by the food that is really exquisite! The best: delicious gluten-free pizza and pasta ‚ù§ and many options of everything.\n",
      "Authentic Italian. The local roll is cool. Mix of homey place with modern paintings that will catch your attentionHomemade and delicious food with Italian products. They have a weekly menu of seasonal productsTry the saltimboccas and ask for some seasonal stuffed pasta!More information on my Instagram üòä\n",
      "The truth is that you eat very well, but it is a miracle to be able to sit down or you are very full on the weekend or during the week at 3:15 p.m. they no longer take orders to eat, being in Barcelona you should have a slightly longer meal schedule, The typical thing is to close the kitchen at 4:00 p.m., there are people like me who work until 3:00 p.m. and we cannot enjoy a good pizza\n",
      "Good gluten free pizzas. Service (waiters, kitchen) friendly but very very slow.\n",
      "Cozy restaurant, delicious and quality dishes, friendly waiter. Highly recommended if you are in that area.\n",
      "Very good! Good food and excellent service!\n",
      "Italian restaurant. There is pasta, pizza and Apribocca which is like a sandwich that the bread is made of pizza dough. Very good service and very clean.I ordered bacon pizza. It was very good. The dough makes it thin.\n",
      "Very charming Italian restaurant in the Poblenou neighborhood. Everything we ate is excellent. I recommend the Saltimbocca, it is like a panino made of pizza dough .... the one with porchetta is very good. The treatment of staff is excellent.\n",
      "Very good service and the salads\n",
      "The deal leaves a lot to be desired. Pretty edges. Besides, they have taken too long to bring the food. Luckily the food was pretty good, which is why I put the stars. Everything else wrong\n",
      "A different proposalI must say that there are hundreds or thousands of restaurants of Italian gastronomy in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbut at least in all the ones I have been to, I have not managed a proposal like this, since here they sell a typical dish from an area of ‚Äã‚ÄãItaly called saltimbocca, making That this place stands out from the rest, however, here you can also appreciate dishes that we already know and that we have surely tried.\n",
      "We have already come several times and will be back!Very happy every time with food and attention. You can eat gluten-free and lactose-free without problems, they are also very nice and are always willing to help or adapt the menu if necessary.The very thin gluten-free pizza dough, which is not very easy to find.Highly recommended corner in Poblenou ü§§\n",
      "Spectacular. One of the best pizzas I've had in Spain. And the super nice team. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Quality homemade food and good prices. Desserts were delicious and the service was very attentive and helpful.\n",
      "The food is delicious and the prices are really fair. Desserts are \"mortal\" !!!Come over and take a look!If you are close to Poble Nou beach, you need to try apri bocca's food. Excellent service, top quality food, delicious desserts; and the best, at a fair price. It's a piece of Italy in Spain!\n",
      "Discovery. I ordered a chicken saltimbocca with spinach, gorgonzola, caramelized onion, and walnuts. It is a kind of sandwich made with a thin and crispy pizza dough, the waitress recommended it to me and it was an absolute success. The accompaniment can be homemade chip potatoes or salad. I ordered potatoes and they were very tasty, although some salt was still left. The dish deceives because it seems little but full !! I asked for dessert a canoli that is like a joint filled with ricotta and chocolate, it was incredible although it was not just filled and it showed that the dough was not as crispy as it should be, but without a doubt everything exquisite. 100% recommended.\n",
      "Another great find, delicious food and great service\n",
      "Today we have eaten 4 adults and 2 children (one of them celiac) in this restaurant and the truth is everything is very good. Very attentive waiters and very good food. We will be back for sure.\n",

      "100% Italian quality food. Very friendly waiters. The wild boar ragout is a delicacy ..\n",
      "Good quality food very well presented with excellent attention and very friendly treatment. Quite a detail that they have gluten-free and lactose-free options. Thanks!\n",
      "I expected more, they took a long time to bring us the seconds. We did not like the three hummus and the fried pizza, the toasted pizza dough would have been a much better option, as it maintains the flavor of the dough and the hummus is enjoyed with it. All that frying it does is grease a dish that is eaten by hand, which makes it more cumbersome and leaves a flavor of frying oil in all the bites you eat. The second ones were good, the gnocci very tender and smooth, the other very good pasta with a powerful bacon flavor.\n",
      "Nice place, professional and efficient staff, great pizzas and desserts, and almost everything can be made gluten-free. It is appreciated being able to choose between more than 2 gluten-free pizzas (in other places you have a couple and thank you). And if you call in advance and comment (if possible that day) you can take your dog. Another very important issue with the times that run, is that they maintain distances, masks ... 100% recommended.\n",

      "We made a reservation and they didn't make us expect anything. The place is cozy despite being small (at least in the part where we were). The waiters super friendly and attentive at all times. They advised us about their specialties and dishes of the day. We opted for pizzas. They were really good. They have take away service (to pick up at the store). If you can't finish the pizza, they offer you to take it home.In my case I asked for pizza, if I remember correctly, it was called \"Tu voi fai la americana\" (photo). Very complete and rich.Good value for money.I highly recommend this site.\n",

      "So happy that you have gluten-free Italian food for those who can't eat wheat! Gnocchi, pasta, tiramisu\n",
      "I have not been given the option to try it. It is a place in the neighborhood and, at 3.44pm (closing at 4.30pm) we wanted to make a coffee (there were 4 of us) and some dessert but it seems that they do not serve if it is not for lunch, according to what they told us. So nothing ... too bad we won't give another chance.\n",

In Bcn it is very difficult to find a place where they make gluten-free food, but in Apribocca you can find pasta, pizzas, lasagna and even beers for celiacs. Very good!\n",
      "The restaurant is very good, these unique sandwiches in flavor, homemade and delicious are wonderful, I recommend you! And the homemade potatoes are also very worth it!\n",
      "Gluten-free options and very good ... it lacks more variety of pasta\n",
      "Very good food and very friendly waiters.\n",
      "Delicious food and close treatment. I would go back without thinking.\n",

      "Delicious snacks and Italian food\n",
      "A beautiful place, very good service- very attentive waiters and the dishes very good, but I suppose I have gone with excessive expectations ... I have tried pasta with wild boar ragu in Florence and I was excited to see it on the menu and although it was not bad It had nothing to do with it ... the same pizza- it was good and I always ask for the same one and here out of curiosity I took another and although it was good it was not what I expected ... and I asked if the canollo is fresh, they have told me that it is , but the dough was not crunchy when tasting it and then if they have said that it is fresh since noon perhaps I have explained myself wrong ... asking about freshly made would be more specific, but I did not think that the word fresh is something so subjective and It is ... total ... atmosphere, very good service, good dishes, salad we liked a lot but it can be improved\n",

      "I do not know I have not been able to try it because it is bursting and without respecting the number of people without a mask. Above that it says take away they tell you that they have trouble and they do not do it, but staying in the place with 30 other people does seem good to them\n",

      "Impeccable service. The restaurant is very well decorated. It is not very expensive for the level of food and service they offer. I really like grilled octopus and cheesecake. The rice in paella was somewhat stale. The rest is perfect. Thank you very much for this experience\n",
      "Very good service and very good quality of food, the perfect fish and meat, incredible desserts ... !!!\n",
      "Quite a discovery. I loved it. The spectacular ham croquettes. I have been wanting to try more dishes on the menu. Pristine service, not the slightest suggestion, very friendly and attentive.

      "I ate the octopus for the starter and the tuna tartare for the main according to other people's reviews. The price was a bit high, but the taste was very good. Olive sausage is also served on the bread before the meal There is also a grilled baguette to go with the tartar The staff are very friendly Especially The tall male employee wasn't there when he woke up, but he waved his hand and greeted me loudly.\n",

The service has been very careful at all times, serious and friendly at the same time without shying away from small jokes. And the excellent dishes, a soft and tasty cannelloni of pularda, a few feet of pork with ratatouille that spoke and a more than correct meat rice.

      "As the name suggests, this restaurant is \"old\": the decor is old-fashioned (although worked) and faded (stains on the menus, toilets a little dirty ...), the food good but with recipes and tastes a bit dull. In the end, we went with the Fork (-50%), and luckily, because the prices are ridiculously high! If you are looking for modernity and excellent cuisine, you will find much better in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbut it is still a good meal.\n",
      "For special celebrations, it is worth it. The food is delicious, but it should not be otherwise, since the prices of dishes and drinks are high (and that is why it is necessary to go with the fork discount at 50%).On the other hand, even though the waiters were friendly and quick to serve, I think they should know a little more about room service protocol ...That of removing dishes when there are diners eating still at the table is not done!\n",

We will return for sure at noon to try other dishes and to appreciate the food, the decoration and the painted walls, because it was very cool!\n",
      "Opinion of a Mexican: really Mexican food !!! I had doubted trying Mexican food in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbut what a surprise I have been! The authentic Mexican flavor and touch, from the drinks; experience the beer with Clamato or a paloma (tequila with grapefruit soda). The cochinita is worthy representative, but the carnitas tacos and the ceviche (with lemon and spicy) are the best, as we really eat in Mexico. First-class service, well-served dishes and a traditional Mexican atmosphere. When you want to know what real Mexican food is like .. go to San Pedrito!\n",

      "Good brazilian food\n",
      "I ordered coxinhas (3) and a picanha menu with rice, potatoes and feijoada.The drumsticks: crunchy dough on the outside, the filling is cold on the inside!The menu: the potato was a yellow to almost orange color, I would say it fried twice, the feijoada was not from today, it looked like it was heated in the microwave ... little flavor. Rice was anything but Brazilian, to those without grace we found in Europe.I'm not a meat specialist but what I will say is that it left something to be desired.Two stars ‚ú® because the brigadeiro was the one who saved the visit, the coxinha would be great if it wasn't cold inside.Reception: I couldn't feel the \"Brazilian cosiness\"\n",
      "Traditional and original Brazilian. Authentic flavors of Brazil\n",
      "Horrible delivery service !!! Too bad, it doesn't work.\n",
      "The Feijoada menu for ‚Ç¨ 15 with dessert and drink is very good!\n",
      "Interesting Brazilian place to eat snacks made from Brazil, Sunday there is feijoada.\n",
      "It took about 10 minutes to serve 2 coffees, although the Brazilian boy was later nice to us. Nothing to do with the other two girls, who when going to pay with a ‚Ç¨ 5 bill did not want to take it because it was somewhat worn out, and they thought it was fake (then verified that it was not). Both edges, except the boy. The star is for them to realize and treat the customer better.\n",
      "A way to be in Brazil without having to fly there.\n",

      "Very good customer service and good food. 100% recommended\n",
      "We have been several times and everything is very good, in addition to having a fantastic terrace. Two negative points, on the one hand, food often takes a long time, it seems that the kitchen is easily saturated. And on the other hand, the boss goes in and out with the mask on his elbow, and in the current situation I think anti-Covid measures should be taken more seriously. On the last day one of the waitresses also served you with the mask on your neck.\n",
      "Nice place. Excellent atention. High quality\n",
      "Highly recommended, food a 10 üëå, good service and unbeatable treatment!\n",

      "I am delighted with the result and we are very good at serving Natalia! Thank you very much for all your attention\n",
      "It seems that the cooks changed. Before we were always happy but today the Kibo bagel has been very dry, it lacked honey and fresh cheese and for the A√ßai bowl they should not ask for ‚Ç¨ 8\n",
      "Beautiful place, divine waitresses and the chef of the night a genius! Super recommendable\n",
      "Different place in the middle of the maritime front where there is nothing! I recommend going in the morning for breakfast or brunch .. Then they don't have much to offer, but their specialty is great.\n",
      "The brunch was quite rich and the people were very friendly.\n",
      "The food is great and reasonably priced. The terrace is very comfortable. Attention is a bit slow.\n",
      "Good food, good location and excellent treatment. Thanks\n",
      "Very good everything they serve\n",
      "Very friendly and personable. A very good multilingual customer service\n",
      "Friendly waiter, beautiful place and excellent situation. But the food average because what we ordered were frozen. The bravas and squid rings, the only thing that has been saved were the toast with bread and tomato that has only been a slice divided into three parts üòÇ only waiter, so the service takes but it is understood.\n",
      "I love good food good presentation, great location, maybe a little disorganized and delays in orders, but I will be back\n",
      "My assessment is negative because in this place a mask is no longer used. We went last week and the waiters and the rest of the staff do not take it inside or on the outside terrace of the premises. For this reason, I will not return or recommend this establishment.\n",
      "It took a long time for the food to arrive, but it was fantastic, tasty and nicely presented.\n",
      "Very very slow service. We canceled a dish because it never arrived. Several things we ordered they didn't have, like French fries, as incredible as it may sound.We order a hamburger only the meat and they bring us a complete hamburger. Chaos, and it's not cheap either. We will not repeat for sure.\n",
      "Well enough\n",

      "It is a wonderful place with an excellent terrace, it is very cozy to share with your friends, family or partner.The attention is very good and the food is highly recommended. 100 out of 100üëåüèº‚ù§Ô∏è I would return a thousand times more ....\n",
      "I made the trip on purpose to eat there, following the positive reviews. Unfortunately the hours are not up to date because in reality the curtain was half down and the men inside told me it was closed.\n",
      "The service attention was good as well as the terrace but the food is super expensive for a ridiculous portion.The squid you pay 7 euros for 6 units more than ‚Ç¨ 1, it's a joke it's Spain but at least it was the only one that was rich.The bravas were half raw and really one of the worst I've ever eaten in a restaurant. The hummus is light but also has no taste.I recommend only for drinks.\n",
      "The only thing I can say in favor is the kind treatment of the person who attended me. But the toast with Egg Benedict and guacamole. The guacamole was not homemade, I bought the one from Mercadona at home and it tasted exactly the same. The egg was a bit lacking, the sauce had no flavor and seemed to have been several days old. They put sweet paprika on the toast and it didn't do well either, this is obviously to my liking. The worst thing is that while I finish drinking my coffee, what seems to be the owner starts yelling at the person who serves me in the middle of the room and making ugly gestures. I think it is not something that should be done, out of respect for the hard-working person, and for the image you give ... There are times to talk about things (with respect). Anyway. From my experience it is not something that I will recommend to anyone.I've had better eggs at Citizen.\n",
      "Great place, dogriendly and with a terrace. The staff is the best of the best, super attentive, friendly and very professional, they are quick and always get the suggestions right. Today we discovered the hot brie and dried fruit toast, and we loved it! :) Eager to try the breakfasts and pancakes they have for brunch! Ideal for coffee or afternoon drink ^^\n",
      "Excellent attention from the team, the place is very warm, they always welcome you with a smile, the food in my opinion is excellent, I am a vegetarian and they have many options so I visit it frequently. So for me it is a great option in Diagonal Mar.\n",
      "Brunch justito fair quality frozen product nice terrace and good atmosphere but they should take more care of the quality of what they offer a shame because the place is cool\n",
      "Very nice place to go !!! Attention is the best! Sofia took care of us and she was very kind.I recommend this place 100%\n",

      "Nice atmosphere excellent attention\n",
      "After almost 1h waiting for 2 toasts we left without eating and on top of that they wanted to make us pay for the drink. I reminded them 3 times that we were still waiting and while they were serving take out. When we saw that they were serving another table that had arrived long after we left. A shame because the place is very timely.\n",
      "The best tacos in all of Barcelona! Super\n",

      "Great service!! üòç Very nice cooks and waiters! Very good meals!\n",
      "The place is fine, the terrace is acceptable and inside it is well placed. But the food is very weak, we ate some bravas (bag), squid (bag), a very average edamame and some cheese finders with raspberry sauce (super) that were worth nothing. A shame\n",
      "It's perfect, good atmosphere ...\n",
      "Spectacular quality of cuisine, and excellent service from Sofia!\n",
      "We were there on Saturday. You can tell that they don't have the service controlled at all. It will take forever to bring us everything from dishes to drinks. I had an English breakfast that was not rich either, which is a shame, because the terrace is very cool. In the end we had to cancel some teque√±os, because surely it would not reach us.\n",
      "Great breakfasts and brunch just a step away from the beach!\n",
      "Excellent place!!! I eat delicious, abundant and with unsurpassed attention!I recommend them again!\n",
      "Very nice place, with the possibility of being outside in the sun. Sof√≠a's attention was very good, very attentive and friendly. Food is delicious. The menu is extensive. I recommend the eggs benedict brunch. They have a vegetarian option, it's the one I chose. Very rich!!! Bonus: close to the beach. So after eating you can walk around a bit :)\n",
      "Excellent food and service. Everything is on level\n",
      "The best place to eat in this neighborhood! At least twice a week I go, it is also comfortable because there is enough space for the children to play and I have them in sight.From the menu I recommend the hamburgers and the Bennedict eggs, but anything you order will be great.The staff is also very friendly.I recommend!\n",

      "Inattentive, slow and disorganized service. We had to order the coffees 3 times ...\n",
      "Not being a sushi fan I accompanied my husband who likes it so much and I was surprised how super good that of citrus is. I really recommend it to all people who don't like it in general. I'm sure they will change their minds as it happened to me. Flavors range from delicate / citrus to stronger and more intense but always balanced flavors. Excellent value for money. üëç\n",
      "INCREDIBLE VIEWS OF THE PASSAGE OF GRACE. Very friendly welcome, the quality of the products exquisite, although the quantity is not as expected. With that, the value for money is right.Very attentive and friendly waiters.A more careful preparation of the dessert would be needed.\n",
      "Magnificent setting and dishes. Impeccable service and a beautiful wine cellar.\n",
      "Well, another place for which I lack stars: it would deserve 6 the truth. Ideal atmosphere, good service and delicious fusion food, between Mediterranean and Asian. The truth is that we entered by chance (we saw the cover from the opposite sidewalk in Paseo de Gracia) but what was said: 10 out of 10. Even the coffee with ice: nice glasses, full of ice ... For me these details are important :) We ordered a Cava Sandra and she was crying for good; The delicious mommy rolls and the Beef Burger with pineapple, cheese, wasabi mayonnaise and sweet potato fruits is one of the best I have ever eaten in my life ... On its website it is defined as \"a restaurant of sensations\" and I correct: \"very good sensations :) In summary: if you are in Gracia / Plaza Catalunya, don't even think about it: this place is 10.\n",
      "I got to know this place while walking around Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãI had access to the experience of trying their dishes and I can only have good words.From the first moment the treatment of the staff was correct and elegant.Well decorated and air-conditioned premises.I ordered sushi, broken eggs with ham and a vegetable wok and it was all delicious.The sushi is made at the moment, you can see from the room how 2 people are continually making it.The price is correct considering everything that I have detailed.All the best.\n",

      "Everything was very good, from the food to the attention from the staff who offered us vegan alternatives off the menu for one of the diners. One of my favorite places in Barcelona.\n",
      "Horrible. We went 6 years ago, and very bad. After so long, we decided to give it another try. It is just as bad, or worse. The attention at the entrance is dire. The girl from 6 years ago was unpresentable. I don't know if it's the same, but just as bad. Avoid it\n",
      "The eye eats too ..., the wine was very rich, dry, fruity, but I'm still hungry ...\n",
      "Restaurant very well located. Very friendly and attentive staff. Good food, with local and Asian dishes. Good separation in the tables by Covid measurements. Good views of Passeig de Gr√†cia. I recommend the 4 cheesecake!\n",

      "The service is very good and very well located, with beautiful views of Passeig de Gr√†cia. The food we ordered was good, but not freshly made, it was noticeable that it was made hours before and stored in the fridges. A pity ...\n",
      "Good space with large windows towards Passeig de Gr√†cia, correct kitchen and service ... But very poor cleaning and maintenance in the toilets ... In particular the men's toilet taps, completely rusty and dirty.\n",
      "Restaurant with an excellent location and a menu bordering on excellent\n",
      "I have been quite a few times in the past and it was very good, both the food, the attention and the place. Today I wanted to place an order for tonight. They have made me call twice during the morning and they expect me to call again when they open in the afternoon ... what a waste of time. Customer service seems to have worsened as they seem to be annoyed by customers. It gives me that we will not return ...\n",
      "Already from distant acquaintances and good memories, he has continued to adapt to the new times. The dining room is comfortable, spacious, elegant ... The service attentive and relaxed.

      "Good product quality. A little overpriced, which is precisely why I become demanding. They ask you at the entrance if the menu is in Catalan or Spanish. We spoke Spanish, the waiter who served us spoke to us all the time in Catalan even though I spoke to him in Spanish. It seems to me a lack of education considering what you pay.\n",
      "Very pleasant climate\n",
      "Good attention. Good sushi. Small but tasteful dishes. The wines, as usual, expensive (300% + than their commercial cost - it shouldn't be the same, obviously, but it might not be that much difference). Nice location.\n",

      "Unparalleled professional frame and very highly recommended tapas and service\n",

      "Beautiful restaurant, very quiet and very good service. We did not like the food, we tried to design food without success, which made the price and quality very expensive. We will not be back and it is a shame since the place is charming ..\n",

      "Very nice place, with charm, of which they are not easily forgotten. In addition, with very good attention from the service. A menu of 15 euros on the weekend (without the drink) very correct, varied enough and with very good dishes. Excellent value for money. And the location: in the heart of the Born!If you have to go, you better make a reservation! I did it through their website and everything ... perfect!\n",

      "Excellent place, with Chilean national food, the attention is super good and the cook is very friendly\n",
      "What a joy to find a Chilean restaurant in the center of Barcelona! It is not a very well known cuisine in Spain and it was really a pleasant surprise. We entered with the fixed idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtasting a chupe and we found it, Chupe de marisco that did not disappoint. We also ate a Palta Reina, delicious when ripe and without much mayonnaise, a light and perfect starter. They even have Chilean desserts, like the lemon pie and the 3 leches cake. We hope it stays open for a long time so that you can continue to expand your menu and bring us more delicacies from Chile.\n",

      "The quality of the dishes in this restaurant of Chilean descent is very good. We ordered 4 dishes to try different things, all were very well executed and the quality of the raw material was evident. We also tried the pisco sour and they were also very well done. The waiter who served us was very friendly and the quality / price ratio was correct. I don't think you could ask for more from a restaurant. We return for sure!\n",

      "We usually went to another Chilean restaurant, but with my wife we ‚Äã‚Äãwanted to try this one because of the reviews it had.Of everything they offered on the menu, they only had half, there was no seafood, earthquake, sangria, kneaded bread etc ...We can understand that on September 18 and 19, is when the national holiday of Chile is celebrated, and there is more attendance than normal, but there is something called \"forecast\", the very friendly waiter, he tried to excuse himself and apologize, but it's not his fault.The first impression was not very pleasant, the pine pies very tasty and just right, the cheese ones tooOverall not bad, but could improve.\n",
      "Great service! The waitress was good advice for our son in choosing the dish, she even brought him some pencils to draw! Quality of the dishes at the top, we had a great time!\n",
      "A lovely Chilean restaurant. The delicious empanadas (we loved the pine one I would have taken 100 !!) and the very nice and attentive waiters. Keep it up guys :)\n",

      "100% recommendable, the flavor of the empanadas I loved is very homemade and transports you directly to Chile. I also tried the chorrillana (a very generous portion for 2 people) which was delicious, the meat at an excellent point, the spectacular chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãand the very crispy potatoes, well accompanied by the caramelized onion and the fried egg. To return, without a doubt to try more dishesüëç\n",

      "Yesterday we went with my husband to have dinner for the first time in Torres del Paine and our conclusion was that this is by far the best Chilean food restaurant in town.Torres del Paine makes you travel to Chile with each of its gastronomic products. The incredible oven empanadas, better than many I've had in Chile. The delicious corn cake is the same, and the lemon pie is delicious.To the delicious food is added a beautiful decoration and first-class attention. Juan, its owner, very friendly and attentive. Iv√°n, who works with Juan, is very nice and kind.I recommend visiting this place, impossible to regret it! We will surely be back soon.\n",

      "Disappointment, the truth was we went there to discard (the other one that we had thought was closed) and we were guided by the comments, but the truth would not return, we ordered corn cake it had good flavor, but the quantity was little (little girl inside) for its price It was a bad choice, there were 2 things we ordered and they didn't have food and drinks too short ... I had to eat with water. The truth is that we left there hungry and to eat a sandwich somewhere else! I have traveled to Chile several times and have been to restaurants in Valencia, and they give this one a thousand times. I hope that in the future they can improve the portions and their content. Because eye the taste is good!\n",

      "A quiet place for connoisseurs.Almost hidden, this Braserie is a real treat. Perfectly quiet next to the street in the very popular city of Barcelona. A good mix of modern latinamerican roots and spanish cuisine. Simple menu and yet delicious. No dish I did not mouth.1. The bottle of wine. Coto elosegiIf it was cold, then this red wine was still a real pleasure2. Entres: Arroz Meloso de sepia en su tintaA good greeting from the sea. Fabulous flavors that remain until the last bite a successful selection. The abundant seafood gives the whole a final touch of texture brass and tastes even more interesting. Overall, a successful home-cooked dish, which only looks for its same.If I had something to munch on, then it was only that it was a bit generous for me in this case the portion. So that I did not quite manage the main course. However, I have to say. My colleagues managed both without problems. So that's more my feeling.3. The main course: Secreto de IbericoA simple marine Ib√©rico filet that comes grilled on a plate with fries so I ordered it. Perfect grilled juice and very fragrant only to be recommended.4 the dessert: dulce de tres lechesAn explotion for the taste senses.The perfecte. Perfect golden brown caramelized. It adorns this very delicious cake. The very light and a sufficient sweet possessed, the one only gently kissed and the desire for more stimulates.5. BRASERIS CARNIVALRelaxed atmosphere. Great music. Class food.The food was with 12,50 ‚Ç¨ without drinks a cheap treat, which in other restaurant with poorer quality also good and sometimes three times.Come and eat. Enjoy it friends. And remember. Food does not have to be expensive. But it always has to taste\n",

      "Bad experience, after waiting almost 15 minutes without being served, I get that they do not have complete or Chilean drinks, only cheese empanadas, I will not returnI am surprised by your answer, if they changed the table it is because the waiter changed it without any kind of covid measure nor did I desifect it, also as a customer I do not have to know the menu, do not worry nor do I plan to return only if you want to tell me The face that I am cool, and learn to be a little more person all the criticisms are answered in a Chula wayPS: don't they have sandwiches?

But the pop was totally burned. The carrillera we had to return to because she really had a burning taste, you could not eat it. It was hardly made inside (as we like) but the fully-soaked top layer. A pity because we had a lot of anarchy's cookies, but a good cook can not burn a product. It is true that they did not charge us the plate and the service was attentive to give us another option.\n",

      "A cozy place with friendly treatment and spectacular food, I'll be back for sure!\n",
      "We had been going for a while and it was well worth it. It is a cozy place where the treatment is very attentive and friendly, and the food is incredibly good at a reasonable price. The quantity is also good, they are not precisely small dishes (at least the yakisoba and sweet potato noodles).They had no problem preparing their yakisoba noodles but without prawns (I'm allergic) and even adding more vegetables. They are attentive to allergies and intolerances.I liked everything, the very good tempered salad, the best yakisoba I've had and the dessert truffles are spectacular (they have a lot of flavor and the detail of wearing an outer layer that creaks when biting is very cool). Even the beer with lemon was very good, mixed there, no bottles already mixed.He catches me close to home, so I will surely come back because I liked him so much üòä\n",

      "Very original and super good dishes ... every time I go there they surprise me üëèüëè Highly recommended\n",
      "Quiet and very cozy place. The menu incorporates very interesting surprises, and they have a short wine list but with good references. The kitchen is very good, and the girls who serve the room are charming. It is a restaurant to recommend and to return to.\n",
      "I love hummus, croquettes, foie and entrails, although with any dish you are right. The homemade and good desserts, although I miss the brownie with vanilla ice cream that they have taken from the menu (why ??? !!!!).

      "A discovery of Thai cuisine in Barcelona. With generous portions, a well-explained menu for those unfamiliar with this cuisine and flavors true to its origins. Young Akai (forgive the writing) gave us exceptional, attentive and friendly service, making recommendations and adapting as much as possible to our needs. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "A lot of Chinese eat Thai food, the price is very high, because the portion is very large, there are many side dishes, it is very recommended. The Thai-style raw spring rolls are full of fillings, and the dipping sauce is sweet and sour sauce with crushed peanuts. It is a good appetizer. Green curry sizzling pork shoulder and red curry coconut milk duck are both recommended. The green curry is sweet and the red curry is spicy. There is also the mango glutinous rice that is ordered at every table. In fact, dessert is not a staple food. You can save a little while eating.\n",
      "Delicious food, food service people take good care.\n",
      "Authentic Thai food and very good attention from the waiter who served us. I did not know the place and it was a very good surprise. Without a doubt, to repeat!\n",

      "I love Thai foodüòä\n",
      "The pad thai and the mango rice are super good! The tom yang kung has a pretty strong flavor (with other restaurants I've tried) but it was good. I highly recommend the thai tea !! The staff very attentive and friendly!\n",
      "Exquisite and charming. Also pleasant treatment. There are vegetarian options, marked with a \"V\" in green, but it is better to ask because there are more than those that appear on the menu, although not many. There is also an icon that indicates if it is a spicy dish.I tried a type of soup, with coconut milk and galangal, tempura, and tofu with peanut sauce. For dessert the chocolate brownie and also the mango rice, delicious? All food great. The decoration is very careful in general, with a beautiful golden armchair at the entrance.I can't say anything about the price as I was invited, but I think it was \"average\" for the quality. It also has a small terrace on the street.\n",
      "Whenever we travel, we try to go to a Thai to eat a Pad Thai. In this case we ordered Tempura, Pad Thai and Ku See from the express menu. The food was okay, but it wasn't 4.6 as Google suggests; the tempura was too fat and the pad thai lacked a bit of flavor punch. Of course, the quantity, for the price, is very good; I expected a smaller plate having lost the express menu and no, it was the same size as the plate we ordered from the menu\n",
      "Very good! Spectacular red curry, and also very good summer rolls and Pad Thai. Super friendly and attentive service. Very correct price. We will be back for sure :)\n",
      "It's a really good Thai food restaurant. I went for the first time before going on a trip to Tail√†ndia. And after coming back from there I have returned more times to Thai Zaap. The food reminds me 100% of the food there. Besides that everything is very good, it is not expensive at all.\n",

      "I love the attention here, apart from the food that shows the good quality it has, fresh products and good seasoning. The menu is spectacular, I loved the presentation. And the place is beautifully decorated. I recommend it\n",
      "A bit disappointing, really. I can't speak too many dishes, but we ordered the spring (mediocre) rolls, the KUNG MAKHAM, where the shrimp batter spoils the whole dish because the prawns were floury and the taste of fried oil stood out above all else . The sweet and sour sauce is good, but the main ingredient is not. Green curry improved expectations but without too much joy and with an excessive taste of turmeric. Desserts are not good intentions. Efficient and friendly treatment and average price between 25-30 ‚Ç¨.\n",
      "Another discovery about Thai cuisine. Cozy atmosphere with authentic decoration. Exquisite treatment by the staff and very well presented dishesWe spent some time here for this meal and grabbed a card .... and it had to be tried. A great success.

      "Mango glutinous rice, it is a dessert, but it is my favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è You must order it when you go! !Tom Yum Goong soup, drink it in the first bite. It has the same effect as Guangzhou's stinky fart vinegar, but the soup base is pork bones? Chicken bones? fish bone? I don‚Äôt know... Fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, etc. are also added to the soup, which has a Thai flavor.You can also try the pineapple fried rice! ! If you can‚Äôt eat spicy food, you can tell the waiter sister, let it be less spicy! ! üåöüåöDon‚Äôt ask me why I know, if I ask, I‚Äôm horrifiedThe remaining cold skin Thai spring rolls, what kind of pork meat green curry, what you want to eat, it is best to let the waiter brother recommend itüíØüíØ\n",
      "The green curry soup with 6 prawns and a variety of vegetables is very delicious. I even had bamboo shoots and I was very happy. The younger brother and sister of the service are very nice and service. When I was in China, I didn't eat Thai food at all. Because there are so many choices in Chinese food, I am now trying to try different dishes from different countries in my hometown. Recently I have a special love for Thai food curry.\n",

      "I was very surprised by this Thai place, it is small, it has good decoration and its dishes take you on a culinary trip to Thailand, the Pad Thai is fine.

And soon after there are 6 or 7 people you have to wait.But yes, the food ... It is very very good. It is truly authentic. I was in Mexico a few months ago and the flavor really transported me to that trip.One thing, the michelada .... I advise you to try it. Today I don't know even if I liked it or not, but I advise you to try it.The price is perhaps expensive and you leave the place hungry, but the truth is that for the quality of the food and the attention you forget.Even with everything, an authentic place and above all, with super friendly people and workers\n",

He made us shut up in a bad way because he said we were talking too loud, violent, disrespectful. His sister apologized instead and he silenced her. He yelled at us and said he didn't care about the clientele. It has a bar and does not provide quality service to customers. He does not care about comfort, on the contrary, he says that the bar is his home and he can treat people as he pleases.TERRIBLE SERVICE\n",

      "BAD EXPERIENCE! Food and drinks ok but we received a completely violent treatment from the owners for free. They asked us to lower the volume in a terrible way and we tried to dialogue with the man explaining that you can ask for the same in a better way without being so violent, the dialogue was impossible and the only thing he did was make the situation worse by receiving answers like; \"Pay and get out - yes, I was bad if I am not interested in being your friend - we are not interested in your comments, we have been open for 6 years and people will come the same\" among others, very very violent. A \"client\" friend of the pair of brothers who owns the place even more violent responding \"shut up, I don't want to hear you anymore\" looking to the side and raising his hand next to his face with an extremely violent and threatening gesture. The situation was really unpleasant, so written it is difficult to narrate in totality but it was horrible. She, the owner tried to be a little more friendly apologizing for the discussion to which the brother replied that he did not apologize for him and that we left \"his house\" that although it is his bar and it may be his house, we were like Clients in his premises not as guests in \"his house\". In short, an arrogant, violent and macho treatment of the worst category. ZERO RECOMMENDED.\n",

We decided to leave and I think I don't even notice it.We came to the site recommended by some Chilean friends, but not to return .....\n",
      "The place has good decoration and what we ate was rich, however the prices seem very high and the staff too serious and distant to be compatriots in a foreign country. I thought they would be warmer than other places I've been but I wanted to experience a different place.While we were waiting for the food I ordered something to snack on and when I saw the ticket I saw that they charged us ‚Ç¨ 2.50 for a few olives. Would not go again. Regards.\n",

      "Authentic Chilean cuisine in a family atmosphere. Simple site but very cozy and clean. The corn cake is very good, the avocado stuffed, Chilean wine (and Spanish). They do not make menu but we get everything about ‚Ç¨ 15 to ‚Ç¨ 17 per head, depending on what you order. They don't open very early (on Saturdays we have gone), but it's worth waiting for.\n",
      "A great surprise on my way!I highly recommend this restaurant which serves among other dishes the famous Chilean empanadas ‚ù§Chilean beer and wine to accompany the whole thing, musicians and singers to accompany us throughout this real \"favorite\" surprise.Gained by great emotion, I enjoyed myself alongside my fianc√© who was also won over.\n",
      "Good Chilean food ... highly recommended.\n",
      "Today I went to the restaurant, when I entered and greeted the waitress who was talking to some friends several times, she did not pay attention, one of the friends told us that we were waiting, she told us to go to the table and she would bring us the letter, after 10 min she kept talking as if we were not decided to leave, the place was not only had a table of 4 people already attended and the girls I was talking to.\n",
      "The food, the treatment and the place are spectacular. If you add the price to that, I don't see a better place to enjoy Chilean food or to go for a drink.\n",
      "You have to go on a Saturday or Sunday, when-at least at noon (in fact, it's late in the evening: open at 2.30 pm) - there's live performance of Chilean music. In the interior dining room there are usually diners of the South American country, and, in fact, they eat well. The 'pino' empanada is excellent; the \"small\" dish of chorilla, very complete; and the tiramisu of desserts, good enough. Also highly recommended is pisco sour. Too bad that the woman that attends is so unpleasant.\n",
      "Very good atmosphere, excellent attention, very good meals, the guys who attend very kind and friendly !!! ... I return again and again!\n",
      "Ambience and family treatment, excellent homemade food and very affordable prices. If you want to know Chilean food or are missing or do not hesitate, the Tabo direct!\n",

      "Cheap rich warm attention\n",
      "We had dinner with Machas a la Parmesan (very few), Choclo Cake (homemade and delicious), a delicious sausage and an avocado with shrimps that was the weakest of all. The service attentive and fast. For dessert the lemon pie is very good, the strudel can be too sweet.\n",
      "Terrible experience! Very rude and violent owners very badly educated !!\n",
      "In particular the attention was very good, very friendly, the food very rich, we will definitely return\n",
      "It is a restaurant that combines traditional cuisine with more innovative dishes. Delicious recipes with ideal quantities. Opened uninterruptedly since 1872. I am second to Joc de Cartes.Don't be put off by the vision of a modern tapas bar, hidden behind and below is a large, very quiet restaurant with exposed stone walls. Restaurant with a very nice decoration. I had a ‚Ç¨ 24 menu but we are going to menu.We tried the trip recommendations of their star dishes. Baby beans from the garden saut√©ed with rich squid and myself Squid a la romana, well but they were quite warm.Small and tasty grilled kid ribs with french fries (by the way I expected they would be thin and crunchy and not thick and soft and too much, it greatly detracts from the dish) I ask to change for zucchini or aubergine and they do not have and she has fresh tuna on the grill with grilled tomato, brutal.Delicious homemade gypsy arm dessert. Impeccable service. Very expensive for what I have eaten.\n",
      "The best Steak Tartare I have eaten for many years. Very good.Magnificent place to eat and have a few drinks.\n",
      "Large place, quality food and good service.It is my second time at this restaurant, and I hope to return many more times.\n",
      "A good restaurant, very good service, beautiful premises, traditional Catalan cuisine.Highly recommended.The great wine list they offer is remarkable, it is almost more difficult to decide the wine than the food\n",
      "Very elegant and cozy restaurant. The food was exquisite, we ordered cannelloni and pork trotters. Extensive wine list and good service. We will be back.\n",
      "Fabulous service, quality of surroundings and dishes\n",
      "Extraordinary food. Very nice place. The impeccable service. I have seldom seen an attentive, polite, and efficient service like here. The only negative thing, the price. Despite being very elaborate dishes with very good quality products, I think the prices could be adjusted more.\n",
      "The food is very good, both the first and second and the dessert of vice. However, have we found the undercarriage, which was full of groups? there was a lot of noise and the prices (‚Ç¨ 40) I think a little exaggerated. You know, they take advantage of groups ...\n",
      "Very good place. Catalan food, very rich everything from olives to desserts. Huge wine and alcohol menu, very attentive staff and always giving good recommendations.\n",
      "You always eat well, that's why it won a Joc de cartes award, it's a safe bet\n",
      "Exquisite and quality food. Very elaborate dishes with quality product and good service. Although the place is large I advise to reserve. They have a surprising wine list, you will surely find the one you like.\n",
      "The service, in a hurry to fold, and it looks like the cook the same. The beans with squid were this: beans and squid. No preparation that makes the dish. Extremely flat. The pork foot crunchy were pork foot burgers. The rattan, grotesque. We try it with dessert, and cheese ice cream dipped in syrup‚Ä¶ Totally disappointed :(\n",

Very kind and friendly staff.It is worth coming here.If you've never come and want to try it, come. You will like it and you will want to repeat.\n",
      "It is a local restaurant and bar with lots of guests and good business. We ordered the duck meat with jam, the waiter would ask if I should be a little cooked, the sauce is very good, the sweet and salty mix is ‚Äã‚Äãvery good, but the duck meat has a little too much gluten, not very good bite, reverse cut to small Stuttering is OK, and the serving size is exquisite. Another point of seafood is very amazing, the shrimp and mussels are very fresh and delicious, the sauce and noodles are very delicious, just eat it. Another orange juice is freshly squeezed, it is very fresh and delicious, but the price of a cup is also higher than that of ordinary orange juice. Overall it is a very good restaurant, it is worth noting when you are very hungry.\n",

      "Very good üëç\n",
      "Very good coffee, and the food is not bad, but that they charge ‚Ç¨ 1 per Fuji apple ... I think it is a bit excessive or that they were to pick them up every morning in Japan! üòÖ\n",
      "Local with a great variety of Focaccias of all types and flavors. Very rich. For ‚Ç¨ 0.50 you can add arugula.Every day from 1pm they prepare fresh pasta.You can eat on the premises or take it to go.They make vegetarian dishes, like aubergine a la parmigiana (very tasty); They also have legume dishes such as lentils or quinoa as a salad; gluten-free chocolate cookies (and very tasty, really); piadinas, assorted cakes whether sweet or savory ...It is a good place to go to work or meet for brunch.They have fresh milk, and vegetable.Of course, I will not order American coffee again. Lousy! Bitter, overgrown coffee.Another drink option is beers, waters and I think they also serve wine.For the rest, rich, and correct price. Everything is between 3-6 euros.Very friendly staff, although it shows that if they hired a few more people, they would be in a better environment.\n",
      "Good place to have a snack or eat, food looks fresh and there is variety. Prices a bit high in my opinion.Terrace a bit unattended due to large number of customers and only 2 workers.Local is spacious, with seating and toilets.\n",

      "Good price breakfast menu\n",
      "Neat franchise cafe. It is much more expensive than other cafes. The staff is very friendly, so if you can't find a place to go to the cafe, you'll be satisfied with this. The interior is clean and the atmosphere is quiet.\n",

      "Good place for breakfast or a light snack. I took a pie with baked onions and Gorgonzola cheese. It was delicious)\n",
      "Let's see compared to the other good crumbs, this one has almost nothing, friendly staff, the two nice boys but it was a Friday afternoon and there was little.\n",
      "It is the most beautiful Buenas Migas in the city. The food is not spectacular and for what it offers it is a bit expensive. It is ideal however, for breakfasts and snacks. The sweets are delicious and the coffee is good. The deal is always great.\n",
      "Very attentive and kind staff. Very good coffee I can go with my dog ‚Äã‚Äãwithout any problem\n",
      "We used for breakfast.A bright restaurant with a wide variety of food.Pizza, focaccia, lasagna, etc. are served warm.\n",
      "Good place to have a juice or coffee or a snack in these times of Covid.\n",
      "Functional and to get out of the way. Assorted assorted salads. Slow in customer service and sometimes bad-faced employees who ‚Äòforgive customers with icy looks‚Äô and ‚Äòpunish them with inaudible monosyllables‚Äô. Were it not for the proximity and the supply of salads, I would hardly go back.\n",
      "I have never seen such disorganized and slow employees, where is the manager? OMG never again. I ask for condiments and they tell me at the table when I go there was not very little attention (splau Barcelona)\n",
      "The pleasant place, the delicious food and especially the attention from the first class clerk, she was very friendly.We will repeat for sureüëç\n",
      "It's a shame how fast this restaurant is getting worse. Having good hamburgers as they have, the service leaves much to be desired.In the first place it is not normal that many times they close the kitchen half an hour before the doors close. And secondly and even more importantly, it can't be that the restaurant is SO DIRTY on weekends! On the previous Saturday all the tables full of trash from previous customers, and the floor was full of papers, potatoes, bags, etc. I really do not exaggerate, I hang some photos.I insist, the hamburgers are very good, but if they do not improve or better manage the service of the staff, this business will go to safety.\n",
      "It was a good experience, I'm not a hamburger, they're usually a scam.Well surprise, I fell there of pure chance, the hamburgers that have served me the same as the advertising picture, with some chips that look homemade.They have also given us to taste very tasty cheese triangles.Very nice service, good service.\n",
      "This is a burger joint that is worth it! Top-notch meat, good size, adequate portions, spectacular shakes, table service, price appropriate to all of the above. The only but I can put you is that the bathroom was out of order the day we went and that the heaters outside were off so we had a bit of cold. To repeat for sure\n",
      "The burger was fine, the place was in terrible cleaning conditions. The staff was wrong all orders. And the wait time for the meal was half an hour. We will not return.\n",
      "Quality hamburger and very good flavor. The potatoes were very good and there is a variety of sauces. There is little variety of beers but in general it is a highly recommended place to eat. The service is fast and the workers are correct.\n",
      "It was the first time we went, the customer service was good, they explained what we did not know, etc. The burgers were not bad but it gives the feeling that they wrap a quality product (meat or chicken) with something of poor quality, the bread is dry and tasteless, it is like a slightly more tender sponge. The potatoes weren't bad and the size of the burgers weren't bad, but it makes you want to eat only the inside.\n",
      "Very delicious food. Relatively fast cooking. You order at the machine and they bring it to the table.The bad thing is that there is only one girl for the whole restaurant to clean and serve the food so the tables are with the remains of the old diners.Easy parking in the mall.Highly recommended\n",
      "American style burgers and chicken. We recommend the bacon with onion rings. We don't recommend the shakes because they are made from syrup. Little variety of beers. Served at table, California style.\n",
      "Mixed feelings I have with this site. The burgers are great. We ordered the one with jalape√±os (more jalape√±os appear in the photo than the one they give you, by the way) and the breaded chicken. One with classic potatoes and the other with onion rings. Very good both. You have drinks refill and such. But customer service leaves much to be desired. Waiters who forget orders, who do not attend to you and refer you to their partner (there is no one but him), who do not explain how to take the table totem ... I have been a couple of times, and always I leave thinking that with a good manager, that place would be PERFECT. Because of the big difference between what it could be and what it is, it stays in 3 stars. Hopefully improve customer service.Good for groups\n",
      "The portobelo burger is very good, the meat juicy and the sauce very good. The west burger is not worth that much, it is quite basic .. And the onion rings are not oily, but they do not taste like anything. The treatment is very nice and attentive.\n",
      "Very good burgers and very cozy place. It even has a bar to charge mobiles. Menu prices between 5 and 9 ‚Ç¨.\n",
      "All very tasty\n",
      "The price is perhaps more expensive than other hamburgers but compensates for quality, speed and at each table free mayonnaise, ketchup etc.\n",
      "Excellent burgers! I have eaten Carls Jr in several countries and it is equally good! The criss cut fries the best üëåüëåüëå I'll be back for more üòã\n",
      "A really spectacular place, hamburgers of a good standard, well made potatoes taste good to eat, far surpasses the typical fast food chains, highly recommended !!!\n",
      "It's my second time here, and I went back because I was very positively surprised by the quality of the meat and its price. I did not know the franchise but now it's on my list of places to eat. You place the order and take the food to the table, in addition to pick up the plate in case of staying after dinner.\n",
      "High quality hamburgers and types of beef, including Angus..maravillosa exquisite and tasty burger.Salads and complements for a more balanced menu. The delicious desserts. Of the few Fast food with non-alcoholic beer. Good alternative to other fast food.\n",
      "We came just the week that they opened their second branch in Spain.The service was very attentive and friendly, they asked us several times if everything was ok (clearly they need Feedback).The burgers were super delicious! Lots of variety to choose from and not high prices! For less than ‚Ç¨ 10, you have a whole menu with unlimited drinks. And they even bring everything to the table.I also want to highlight the service again because for dessert I ordered an ice cream and as I was not very attached to the cone, nothing fell to the ground. When the waiters saw it, they immediately brought me a new one for free, thank you!We will return yes or yes! üçî‚ù§Ô∏è\n",
      "Better than the classic competition for ‚Ç¨ 1 more.Sympathetic and attentive. Eye to the rush hours, slower ...\n",
      "Hi there! I ordered the hamburger from the first photo and the second photo arrived at my table.A shame and shameless, I came here on recommendation and I leave totally disappointed. Better than ‚Ç¨ 1 from the Burger King.Before ordering this hamburger we bought a promo from the Website and also more of the same.We will never return !!SCAMMERS !!\n",
      "Fast food restaurant, various menus, also infantile, smoothies, you can fill your soda as many times as you want in the machine ....\n",
      "It is good they are restaurant quality burgers that are charged to 20 turkeys but priced at McDonald or Burguer King, really good juicy meat of good taste and a combination of very successful ingredients with a bread at height (in my white photos what you see is mayonnaise unlike the other sites that charge you apart here you include it)\n",
      "The burgers are good, but the service is not too consistent.We asked on the machine to be served at the table and, when the boy arrived, he had not brought us a glass for drinks (they are refill). It is seen that you have to ask for the glasses at the bar (where, when we went -15 August- there was only one person attending an infinite queue of people), with which in the end we had to make a little queue to request a glass that would not have It cost nothing to bring (even if it was empty) since the size and the drink were specified in the order.I found it a very inefficient system. If you put machines to expedite the issue of orders and queues, do not make us queue for something we have already asked ...It also turned out that the gas from the beverage machine was over and, upon reporting it, they changed it but did not notify anyone when they were finished, which formed another huge queue in front of the machine waiting for information ...I found it a very chaotic service, lacking in staff. The burgers are good but they are not spectacular either and the price you pay in short, there are places where you pay the same or even less and the service is much better.I do not think I'll come back.\n",
      "The hamburger is not tasty, the cutlet is dry and overdone, the onions and ketchup are not put into the hamburger. Very dry and not tasty. I do not recommend.\n",
      "The best hamburger of its style, perhaps a little expensive, definitely worth it, try the unlimited drinking fountain, hundreds of sodas. Big double burgers look great on Instagram.\n",
      "Fast food restaurant inside the \"LA MAQUINISTA\" shopping center whose culinary offer is based on American-style hamburger menus.The place is cozy with tables and wooden benches.The food is of an acceptable quality and its workers are attentive and well educated.A very good option for days when you have time to eat quickly.\n",
      "Very delicious chicken burger\n",
      "The Maquinista store is no longer open, it disappeared with the latest reform of the shopping center.In Barcelona there is only the Splau.\n",
      "Good deal, good food and super fast.\n",
      "Fast service and tasty food\n",
      "Menu double cheesburguer, I have been disappointed by the hamburger, very very dry and scarce meat. A picture is worth a thousand words, it does not even close to that of the poster, that if nothing less than with potatoes come two sachets of ketchup because asking for one of mustard is paid separately. Unfortunately I will not return. regards\n",
      "Excellent service, I was served by a very friendly girl and good food quality price. First time and I will repeat for sure üòÅüòÉ\n",
      "Very good burgers, exceptional quality, has nothing to envy to any hamburger chain, and a good price. The best burguer With Angus meat.\n",
      "The service is fast and friendly. The place was quite full one Saturday at noon and it did not take more than 10 minutes to serve us. The burgers are considerably large and the menu comes out quite on account, with a side dish to choose from and a refillable drink, round between 8-11 euros depending on the burger you order.\n",
      "30 min wait for 2 hamburgers. And no the restaurant was not full ...\n",
      "A good place to eat for 3.95 hamburger, potatoes and drink !! A bargainüòú\n",
      "A very positive first experience, the beautiful angus burgers and the amazing crisp potatoes! Very good service and good treatment, we will be sure! And the coffee tb very good!\n",
      "Very good service, and I'll explain ... McDonalds has not been the same for 10 years, and Burger King is not so filling, but these burgers are tastier and fatter. The potatoes are good, they are different. It is a good intermediate since apparently the Five Guys makes them better, but the staff of this place treated us very well, very homey. Although they should improve on one thing.Give them a screen so they can locate the tables and thus not go everywhere looking for where to deliver. Inside outside, inside outside also with that cold.\n",
      "Few tables in the interior and dirty. Good food\n",
      "I paid 80 cents more to make my menu bigger and it turns out that they don't even have a drink and they give me a medium drink.\n",
      "Some very good quality burgers and a service of 10, the place very comfortable !!! I recommend it 100%\n",
      "‚ò∫Ô∏è Emerli excellent service, delicious food and promotions .... Recommended üëç\n",
      "The grilled chicken burger has enchanted me, the BBQ sauce was very rich, so it needed to be a little more generous with the lettuce and the tomato. The sensational grid potatoes! The Nestea is awful, change cold tea brand. Amazing cookies! Great service, very friendly everyone.\n",
      "In taste we left the usual that are other chains of fast food, I recommend to go at least once. Both the potatoes and the hamburger note quality very different from what we know as the standard of \"Fast food\". I have left happy. They have low prices and large portions.\n",
      "I hope they open more stores throughout Spain. It is much better than other fast food chains.\n",
      "I really like this site. The burgers are simple but delicious, the meat is of good quality and they are always well cooked. They have machines to order and some numbers with which you identify the table and they bring you the food. They have drinks refill. The staff is friendly, the place is clean. Desserts are also very good. I recommend it.\n",
      "The burgers are very good. Agnus meat. Unlimited drink. They have low carb burger. Everything is great.\n",
      "Excellent service and very rich\n",
      "Comment two things:1. The quality of the products and especially the staff are tremendous, of the most competing that I have seen, I come and recognize how often I come. So a 10 for staff and quality.2. I put 4 stars and no 5, because today I have returned and really the lack of staff has noticed, on a Friday night (now they are at 9:30 p.m.) and there are only two people in the room (4 in total in all the rest) the tail arrives at the door, the tables are dirty just like the toilets and there comes a point where they bring you something that is not as perfect as the rest (after asking twice and wait 10min the dessert) and I have not complained because I know that they go from bolit, the boy to the box although it is very fast, the tail accumulates and the girl runs up to 3 trays together in the hand. I do not understand why at such a busy shopping center they put only 4 people on a Friday night and summer.\n",
      "Hamburgers with very good flavor, at a reasonable price.\n",
      "Very good place for lunch or dinner. It is not usually as crowded as other fast food places. The quality of the food is very good and everything is very tasty. They have Angus beef burgers. The drink can be filled.\n",
      "The truth is that cleanliness and service is leaving much to be desired.a shame\n",
      "Web promotions are invented that is only from Monday to Thursday\n",
      "Very good hamburgers. The only thing I don't like is something common to all these sites and all the chains. They allow people to sit at the tables to reserve them before having food. RESULT: I with my tray of food standing looking for a place to sit and, at the same time, several tables occupied by people who are not eating. The day that a fast food chain does not allow this, it will have me as a regular customer.\n",
      "We had never entered and the experience was not bad. The menus are complete, the meat is tasty and the two possibilities of fries are very tasty. In addition, it has a beverage dispenser so you can drink whatever you want.\n",
      "How to explain it finely ..... perhaps one of the largest chestnuts on earthVery slow service, useless waiter, but that is not the worst ..... that they reserve for food. They have in theory several types of hamburgers but they all taste the same, it is incredible you take what you take is always the same. And we are not the only ones that we noticed since several tables have protested the same.\n",
      "Total disorganization, long waiting time and machines to order shutdowns. As if that were not enough, wait in line to order 20-30 minutes to swallow the food with the burned half burger and some raw potatoes.A single person to attend a huge queue of people.Normally the site is very good, but today it has been a disaster.\n",
      "A good place to eat and enjoy. Very fast service and spectacular food.Highly recommended\n",
      "Very competent prices, quality hamburgers. In addition refill of free drinks in a well-decorated place with service at the table and an exquisite treatment by employees. A very pleasant surprise.\n",
      "Deliciosasssdddd\n",
      "We have discovered it today, the Maquinista. We will make sure: Very good value for money, very attentive and friendly staff and very cool place.I comment that I hope that soon take into account large families and make some kind of discount.We have been super to taste, thanks!\n",
      "I have accidentally opened this fast food, and really powerful, they surprise the quality of their burgers, very b, drink all that you want.Quality price, perfect, customer service from the first moment a 10. I will return\n",
      "Lousy service, the food is good, but we were waiting 1 hour for 2 hamburgers with potatoes in a FAST FOOD restaurant. In the end we had to ask to take away. Regrettable.\n",
      "A shame, I was a regular customer but not one more, I was 3 weeks ago and I left very upset by the service and the feeling of dirt but I thought that a bad day has anyone and I decided to give another opportunity. Yesterday I repeated and I do not return anymore, slow and bad service, very unpleasant staff, they changed my hamburger 2 times because I ordered it without sauce and without vegetables, I have to put up with the girl's bad face when I brought my food and to top it off I ask the manager and they tell me he is busy. I'll come back later if you want ... The food is not bad but you pay more for something different and that's not the case ...\n",
      "Good fast food place to eat quality burgers at a good price. There are countless combinations and the staff is very friendly (they serve at the table).\n",
      "I went to Carl's Jr de l'Splau for the first time and I really liked it, today I went to the machinist's and I share the opinion, highly recommended, good service and very good food\n",
      "Good atmosphere and good food. You can smoke on the terrace. It would improve the cleanliness of the bathrooms. The rest is all right.\n",
      "Good design and tasty meat. But far from recommending it, out puts some offers and when you ask for the panel they do not exist, only in a bar, why, the same restaurant? You tell the manager to do the price they put and they can not do anything about it ... Apart from being late in serving for what it is.\n",
      "Very good burgers and take you to the table very quickly and kindly\n",
      "Excellent restaurant for hamburger lovers the extra fries. The big chains can take example. I really advice this restaurant\n",

They come out really fast and that's great.The octopus is perfectly cooked, with a spicy touch and potatoes that taste in the purest Galician style.The seafood platter was brutal. Great everything. It has prawns, prawns, mussels, clams, razor clams and more. It was delicious and in great quantity.Half a serving of each is enough for three people. We accompany it with Albari√±o wine.For dessert, some Celtic delicacies, queimada delicacies and cheese cake. And coffee and shots.All for approximately ‚Ç¨ 103, that between three, pay very much taking into account everything we ate and of quality.The girl who attended us, a wonder. Attentive, cheerful and super agile.Come on, if you can, go there running. That if, you have to reserve.\n",

      "All the friends that I have recommended Maxi repeat. Large portions with tons of rotation. Great neighborhood restaurant\n",

The portions are very generous and a half portion may already be enough. It is a very good place to go with friends or family, since they have large tables for groups, that if it is convenient to make a previous reservation because it is usually quite full, this causes the place to be somewhat jolly so if you want to eat with noise you can Eat on the terrace but in bad weather. I recommend the octopus to feira and the coquillas de mar.\n",

      "Quality product with Maxi portions, at a right price !!!!!\n",
      "It has lost a lot of quality ... We tapas bravas lacon and cuttlefish. The only thing that was worth was the bravas that are frozen, with that I say everything ... The lacon looked like steaks of how fat it is cut, the very hard cuttlefish were hard to chew. And the bread I think was from the day before because it was inedible ...I haven't been here for years and I don't know if the owners have changed or what, but it's not what it used to be ... Horrible! We will never come back\n",

      "Galician restaurant with very large portions. The food is not spectacular but it is good. It is the best in the area. It is always very crowded, it is better to book although they always try to make a hole for you. The value for money is fine although the difference between asking for half or a whole can vary only by ‚Ç¨ 2. It is a good place to go in a group. Very good attention and fast service.\n",

On the other hand, when I have asked for lactose-free milk, they have served me with lactose, it is to take a sip and know that it is lactose-free and complain. It is serious for those who have allergies. On the other hand, many people go with their laptop to do their wonderful homework, they spend hours and until you pay you do not realize that there is not a bloody free table. In my opinion it has gotten worse. And as for prices, it is worth the same as the Starbucks and I prefer to go to the Starbucks that at least they are never wrong with milk.\n",

      "I went to the arrosseria with my family. I ordered a seafood platter, and after waiting an entire hour the lobster was raw. When discussing it with the waiter, he passed it to us on the grill and he brought it burned. Inedible. The desserts have an appetizing but disappointing showcase. Coffee at the price of diamonds.

      "Excellent paella and tapa .. highly recommended ..\n",
      "It was regular, no one told us at 11:30 that they closed the kitchen so when we asked for dessert they told us that the kitchen was already closed and that they only had Catalan cream left (it sounded like an excuse) and that they had had a very hard day and we had to leave because they closed at 12, it was 11:45. We understand the subject, but they left us cut and without dessert; besides the meat was very tough. Rest of dinner fine.\n",

      "Very pleasant waiters who speak French!Everything was very good: fried tapas (ham croquettes) with a paella whose chicken was really tasty! And I haven't talked about the dessert yet, an iced pistachio cookie that delighted my taste buds! In short, a masterclass with more than correct prices since we had some for 92 euros at 3 with tapas, main course, desserts and drinks including a cocktail! I highly recommend !\n",
      "Wanted to have a nice meal there last nightüí™We didn't feel welcome. The waiter switched between so that nobody felt responsible for us.Local families sat at other tables and were given special service.I would not go there as a German guest!Our numerous tapas came so p√∂ a p√∂ that the warm ones were also cold. Oil, pepper, salt and lemon only on request.Too expensive for this quality ...We wanted to spend a nice evening but it was missed a lot ...\n",
      "A small side \"tourist trap\". Correct food but nothing more, correct service but nothing more. We note in particular the breads with garlic (which are in fact slices of toast spread with aioli mayonnaise) that we offer you without indicating the price and which will be billed to you at 2.30 ‚Ç¨ per slice. The dessert tray looks very industrial.Finally, we waited for the bill almost 45 minutes and, when paying by card, the EUR 180.- to be paid became EUR 780.- at the terminal. We want to believe the story of the waiter, who claims that it is his first day and that he has not yet mastered the device, but something tells us that it is regularly his first day.\n",

The views from the upstairs terrace are well worth it. It is impossible to go by wheelchairs to the pwr stairs to the entrance, because the services are located on the part of the terrace that must also be reached on foot.\n",
      "Small but pleasant space, a bit noisy when it's full, service attentive and diligent. Correct dishes in quantity and quality. Moderate price on the high band. The specialty of screws is not very wise. They use boiled smooth screw. The sauce is good but it does not just offer an interesting enough flavor. The shoulder may be a good choice of brass. The wine from the house would be good to improve it. It's a T A, I think a hare and grenache, a bit rough.\n",

It has been unfortunate that although we have requested at least one stove, or a heater, they did not have it. We are a family that the ticket per person has been higher than 40 euros. You already know with not returning ...\n",
      "Place of life where they make the best screws, much better than in Lleida. Now, since they changed owners, the price has risen. It was a perfect place to make snails and grilled meat for a price per person of ‚Ç¨ 20-25. Nowadays, almost always we pay ‚Ç¨ 35 / minimum, making a first plate to share, two seconds, wine from the house and coffee. Yes, I come back through the screws. Watch as you get the bread and allioli that will take you all without asking for it\n",
      "I liked your snails today or that. I recognize that I have eaten them. But they were not the usual. The chicken its specialty and I loved it either. I would like to go back to the beginning of this restaurant. But if it can't be the same as before ..., it's over.\n",

If only they had asked us the reason for our displeasure ... Anyway ...\n",
      "Tibet is a restaurant where they make a great meal. And the waiters are attentive. Also, if you have a table on the front, you can enjoy a good view. It is advisable to book. The only problem is that to access, you have to climb a narrow staircase. And more stairs to the toilet. This complicates access to the elderly and the baby carriages.\n",
      "My wife and I were there last week, after quite some time without being able to go, and we felt at home. The staff very friendly and helpful, and the dishes as always, excellent quality. We will repeat\n",
      "The specialties are prepared very well, pork feet, snails,\n",
      "Today we have gone to eat 9 people. We have ordered to chop esqueixada, escalivada and assortment of sausages. In the first place, we had to return the esqueixada because it was inedible of how bland it was, when returning it nobody asked us the reason. The assortment of sausages had 4 pieces of loin, blood sausage, chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãand sausage .... painful In the second courses, things have improved, that is if the rabbit is overcooked and the entrecote better or ask for it. The companions that are charged a better part or name them (4 chips and raw green peppers). The only thing that is worth it is the lamb, which by the way only had 1 portion left so we have had to settle for asking for something else, when in the menu of seconds there are only 5 things. For dessert there was neither Catalan cream nor mel and it killed. Little variety of everything. That if they do not stop bringing bread. The super friendly waiter but the blonde girl did not even care and worked reluctantly.\n",
      "Poor and very fair cuisine, high prices and very slow service.\n",

I do not know because it was night. The right treatment We ordered a steak, consomm√© and grilled chicken. The entrecot was very good, although the potatoes looked frozen or fried with sunflower oil or ... they were very yellow, the perfect chicken and the disappointing consomm√© ... it looked like bric put in a mud vol ... 5 ‚Ç¨ for that. No thanks ... It would have been forbidden for restaurants to put you cheap boat food and over charged 5 times what it costs 1 lt .... bread with tomato bie, we say we did not want allioli and brought it, evidently what They charged ..

      "The cleaning shines by its absence, the tablecloth was full of stains that tried to cover by putting the napkins on top that also had stains. The glass had to change because it was dirty. The waiters were kicking some standard peppers that had fallen to the ground for a long time. The place fills with smoke as soon as they start cooking. We ordered snails from the llauna, the cook went to another room, came out with a plate of snails and put them in the microwave. The baked kid left a lot to be desired, homemade but bland potatoes and seemed overheated with the kid. The sirloin with very good foie (although we were told that they would bring a plate of side dish fries that never came) and the steaks we saw looked good. It is a place to eat meat exclusively. Affordable price. Regular attention I would rate it with 3 stars for the meat but not too much does not compensate.\n",

Dedicated to the people here, when you book, get yourself understood in Catalan, because they don't know the languages ‚Äã‚Äã.. Fortunately. It is already walled up with people like that ...

Ferrero Rocher dessert with a spectacular spoon and delicious lemon pie. Very quiet and with few tables. I have seen they have a private room for 4 people at the back of the premises. Parking at 50 m c. bruc. Without tablecloth and paper napkin, I did not like this detail for the price of the menu. My congratulations to the entire team.\n",

Once I left, completing the time they told me, I stayed to see that the table was empty for 15 minutes. I felt very ill and I do not think I would come back.In addition, there is no menu.It is a very assorted letter, but with prices too high. The rice with shrimp was good, but not for the small amount and the price ‚Ç¨ 11.Also, drink it apart.No indication of intolerances and, according to them, must be reserved. A little coach for whom, like me, we do not have a fixed restaurant every day, but we repeat the area. What I have clear is that it will take me a lot to go back.Health!üéó\n",
      "Of those small and little known restaurants where you can eat wonderfully, in addition to having a modern and cozy place. There is no lunch menu but you can have lunch for about 25 ‚Ç¨ things like a fantastic cream of artichokes with foie and nuts or an extraordinarily cooked fish rice and for dessert a goat cheese mousse with berries in the their sauce and cookie. The truth is that they are leafy plants and you can do without dessert or replace the first with a chopping board.Recommended for any gourmet.\n",

Especially the duck cannelloni, the viera with pesto sauce and the suckling pig. It was really a long time since I had eaten such good food and so careful in detail. The excellent attention and the very nice place\n",

      "Good cooking Quality\n",
      "Sad place, poor service, embarrassing menu.\n",
      "Highly recommended, everything has an exquisite flavor\n",
      "Every day I pass in front of this restaurant, with a semi-Nordic, minimalist and always full design. Finally I decided to try their \"menu of the day\" after having read a lot of good comments on social networks.They have no menu of the day, they have a short but cool menu with first, second and desserts. Of course, the letter changes every week approx.Prices are high executive level. But executive who is operating bikini, because the portions are extremely small. Let's say that the dishes are like the decoration of the place: minimalist, with hardly any garnishes, scarce but of good quality and exquisite taste.The service is normal. With the price range they have, I think it could be improved a lot.I tried the artichoke and sardine coca (a ridiculous), the steak tartar (super simple, 0 side dish) and the rice (spectacular). All very rich, yes, good cuisine, but not equivalent to the price sold.Recommended for fine palates, reduced stomachs and happy bank account.\n",
      "Haute cuisine at a good price\n",
      "Wonderful menu of quality and high level\n",
      "The service should improve a lot. Rest is correct.\n",
      "Excellent meal, quiet place.\n",

      "Super good food\n",
      "Excellent, delicious Tapas and fine service.Been there five years ago, now been back.Again in 5 years!!!\n",
      "The food and the price of 10. The service - 10. We have ordered 10 skewers, some patatas Bravas and some rejos. The waitress brought us the food half an hour after ordering it and without the drink. Slow, careless, forgetful and clumsy. Of the bars and the Bravas no trace. When asked, he tells us that he has forgotten. A real shame that this restaurant has such bad service. When they solve it there will be no problems.\n",
      "Great experience .. near the Sagrada Familia, good selection of cold tapas. The paella mixed with meat and shellfish is exceptional. Fair price.\n",
      "The food was bomb ...... thePaellia was really good and so were the tapas.Service very friendly and the price is right.If we come back to Barcelona we will definitely eat there again.\n",
      "Very tasty, especially the cold tapas platter was awesome!\n",
      "Normal prices, abundant quantities, it is a pity that the paella rice was overcooked and therefore heavy and that the dish itself had no taste, if not that of lemon. There are places where you can eat better paella. Not recommended\n",
      "It was completely unexpected to find in the tourist quarter both excellent service and very tasty food. It seems that this restaurant is a family one, where it is very important for everyone that every visitor is satisfied. We ordered a small burger for the child, expected a small hamburger. But it turned out that these are 4 small cutlets + village potatoes, very tasty. We took a set of tapas to choose from, the set includes 8 pieces. At first, they could not understand the principle of how to choose them and how to control them. It turned out that you take it yourself, as many times as you want and what you want. Here, these are such small sandwiches with all possible ingredients - salmon, hummus, sausage, tuna, nuts, anchovies, chorizo, jamon and much more. Sticks are inserted into each sandwich, at the end they are counted, and, 8, this is 1 serving, then up to 16 - 2, and so on. We also ordered sangria and again a surprise. Here, however, he was controversial, the wine was tart, rich and not spoiled as usual. It was super. What is not quite super - a lot of sugar, it is difficult to drink, not for everybody. Not at all like most light, effervescent and fruity sangria as used to. It was a pity that we had to leave, we were in a hurry for the train, I wanted to try many other dishes that were brought to our neighbors - luxurious paella, which we had eaten so many times, but here it seemed like a super masterpiece, Andalusian squid, fish croquettes, etc. We recommend and want to eat there again.P.S. The decor is very simple, without pathos, and that's great.\n",
      "Fatal, the new owners are French. The bread was hard and soaked. Hot skewers, now it's time to order them. We will not be going back\n",
      "The tapas should be at 1 euro, you don't realize it and your money is wasted\n",
      "Very good pinchos next to the Sagrada Familia\n",
      "I didn't expect to have such an approachable restaurant next to such a hot tourist area. I personally think that the food is delicious and not expensive, pincho 1.6‚Ç¨/pc, paella 13.35‚Ç¨ (small serving), although the decoration is really not very beautiful, but I highly recommend everyone to tasteLos pinchos y paella son muy ricos. Lo que m√°s importante son los precios buenos aunque est√° muy cerca de La Sagrada Familia.\n",
      "Excellent. A great quality of their products like Pinchos, Tapas, Raciones, A large dining room with very good air conditioning and excellent service by their employees both in bars and tables. A good terrace outside the bar. Excellent attention from the camara @ s Laia, Aran and Quique. And especially the kitchen staff for their rich products. I will go publishing photos ..... if I allow it clear ...\n",
      "We went for drinks and we were very comfortable. The glasses were good but it took a while to bring them\n",
      "Perfect we have a good evening.\n",
      "Good place to eat typical dishes of Barcelona. The tapas that were served were very rich and the paella was homemade, with a delicious flavor and plenty of portions. The place very nice, fresh with a decoration that looks good. The excellent service and the acceptable prices for the area in which it is. I highly recommend this place and above all, the paella.\n",
      "The service is impeccable, the managers are adorable, very nice and good advice! The food is very decent for the price (17th all-you-can-eat menu)I recommend this address for those who want to taste as much tapas as possible !!Thank you again for this pleasant moment!\n",
      "Very good discovery.Warm and welcoming staff.The tapas menus at the top.Value for money by appointment.Super fresh products.I highly recommend\n",
      "Good pintxos at a good price in a cozy place. Good treatment and good service.\n",
      "The price of Pinchos is 1.6 ‚Ç¨. It was 0.1 ‚Ç¨ more than before, but the price has increased. There are other menus, but I think the fun here is Pinchos.All restaurants around the Sagrada Familia are expensive, so it's cheap and easy. The taste is suitable for the price.Since it is open from noon to midnight, depending on the timing, the warmer will turn in order from the back seat, and the rest will be in the counter glass case. So quality and freshness depend on the time you go.All waiters feel good.\n",
      "A place to have good pinchos for ‚Ç¨ 1.50 each.Very friendly treatment and everything at the perfect pace.Very good cabrales cheese potatoes.\n",
      "In my opinion, one of the best places to eat some pinchos and have a beer. ‚Ç¨ 1.70 for both hot and cold skewers.I have had the opportunity to eat there as well and I must highly recommend it.In the end they gave me a strawberry with chocolate, the detail is appreciated.\n",
      "It is a restaurant near Sagrada Familia exit.I've got 8 pieces of cold tapas and a paella mixed with seafood and meat. Although the tapas bread was hard, the topping was delicious. The paella was a bit salty, but the squid and meat were so thin that it was delicious!\n",
      "We were delighted with this establishment. The pinchos are very varied. There is something for every taste. They are of good quality and very fresh. In addition, the place is magical at the foot of the Sagrada Familia. What about the service, perfect and more, very attentive and with little care for its customers. I highly recommend to have a good time.\n",
      "Just amazingly surprised to have found this great place at the foot of the Sagrada Familia! The waitress is of a kindness to any test super amiable who speaks a little French and you will understand very very well in English too! We feasted with these great tapas ... you would judge yourself by these photos ... installed you benefited\n",
      "Vegan Restaurant. I recommend.\n",
      "A toothpick 1.5 Euro sangria 6.15 A cup of bread is crispy The best thing to eat is fried. The ingredients are very sweet! The waiter is very nice, but a little busy.\n",

      "Informal restaurant with excellent location friendly waiters and menus in Italian located near the sagrada family highly recommended the paella and the tapas which are self service only downside the price a little high. Pay attention to the waiter who passes with tapas but they are not free and are paid, but unlike the self service tapas those of the waiter are hot.\n",
      "Tapas very rich !!\n",
      "Good welcome, good place facing the sagrada familia and very good food for cheap\n",
      "Okay, but they have changed owners, before I liked it better, next time to see if it improves\n",
      "Very good food and attention\n",
      "Excellent tapas bar located around the corner from La Sagrada Familia street. Great place to grab a bite to eat before visiting the cathedral. There is an all-you-can-eat menu for around 15-16 euros. Several wines available at reasonable prices. There are a variety of bites on slices of bread: sausages, cheeses, anchovies, apple jelly, tuna, tomatoes, artichokes, etc. There is plenty of room inside and a few tables outside.\n",
      "It is a wonderful restaurant, with excellent service. The food is of a very good quality, all exquisite. We were very comfortable eating on the terrace. The owner is very attentive and friendly. We will repeat again.\n",
      "A restaurant located near the park G√ºell. It is very nice with good windows and good views. The grilled meat and dishes of Catalan cuisine. All immaculate and the staff very friendly. The views from the upstairs terrace are well worth it. It is impossible to go by wheelchairs to the pwr stairs to the entrance, because the services are located on the part of the terrace that must also be reached on foot.\n",
      "Small but pleasant space, a bit noisy when it's full, service attentive and diligent. Correct dishes in quantity and quality. Moderate price on the high band. The specialty of screws is not very wise. They use boiled smooth screw. The sauce is good but it does not just offer an interesting enough flavor. The shoulder may be a good choice of brass. The wine from the house would be good to improve it. It's a T A, I think a hare and grenache, a bit rough.\n",
      "It is a spectacular restaurant. The food is of a very good quality. Judit, who is the owner, is very kind, friendly and attentive.\n",
      "Very good grilled restaurant! The artichokes were a kid for my taste, but the lamb was delicious!\n",

      "The best snails a la llauna in barcelona! I've been coming to this place for 11 years for the snails and the truth is that no restaurant makes it as good as here! The only bad thing is to park, if you go at noon it is the worst to find a parking, at night you can leave the parking in the bus area\n",
      "The place is very well arranged, of course, you have to climb stairs, and the food, first class, Catalan cuisine with a lot of heat. To lick your fingers\n",
      "Very well\n",
      "Nice and spacious place. Pretty good service and delicious food. Highly recommended\n",
      "The place is great and the food exquisite, but the snails are not canned in the Lleida style, they are made with a kind of sauce. They were good too.\n",
      "I honestly expected more and found it very expensive for what we ate.\n",

      "Great very good food.\n",
      "It is a pity that the quality of the product is so diminished by the conditions of the service.Today having room, we have been placed in a dining room on the top floor next to the services and without heating. It has been unfortunate that although we have requested at least one stove, or a heater, they did not have it. We are a family that the ticket per person has been higher than 40 euros. You already know with not returning ...\n",
      "Place of life where they make the best screws, much better than in Lleida. Now, since they changed owners, the price has risen. It was a perfect place to make snails and grilled meat for a price per person of ‚Ç¨ 20-25. Nowadays, almost always we pay ‚Ç¨ 35 / minimum, making a first plate to share, two seconds, wine from the house and coffee. Yes, I come back through the screws. Watch as you get the bread and allioli that will take you all without asking for it\n",
      "I liked your snails today or that. I recognize that I have eaten them. But they were not the usual. The chicken its specialty and I loved it either. I would like to go back to the beginning of this restaurant. But if it can't be the same as before ..., it's over.\n",

      "The place has charisma and charm and the service is good. The dishes are simple and of standard quality.\n",
      "All great congratulations and the blonde very nice\n",
      "In this new normal everything is worse, it is difficult to maintain the illusion for what you do while you see that your castle falls like one of sand, but the treatment received, the neglect, and the violent robbery, in which the correct waiter did not participate, deserve a negative assessment. If only they had asked us the reason for our displeasure ... Anyway ...\n",
      "Tibet is a restaurant where they make a great meal. And the waiters are attentive. Also, if you have a table on the front, you can enjoy a good view. It is advisable to book. The only problem is that to access, you have to climb a narrow staircase. And more stairs to the toilet. This complicates access to the elderly and the baby carriages.\n",
      "My wife and I were there last week, after quite some time without being able to go, and we felt at home. The staff very friendly and helpful, and the dishes as always, excellent quality. We will repeat\n",
      "The specialties are prepared very well, pork feet, snails,\n",
      "Today we have gone to eat 9 people. We have ordered to chop esqueixada, escalivada and assortment of sausages. In the first place, we had to return the esqueixada because it was inedible of how bland it was, when returning it nobody asked us the reason. The assortment of sausages had 4 pieces of loin, blood sausage, chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãand sausage .... painful In the second courses, things have improved, that is if the rabbit is overcooked and the entrecote better or ask for it. The companions that are charged a better part or name them (4 chips and raw green peppers). The only thing that is worth it is the lamb, which by the way only had 1 portion left so we have had to settle for asking for something else, when in the menu of seconds there are only 5 things. For dessert there was neither Catalan cream nor mel and it killed. Little variety of everything. That if they do not stop bringing bread. The super friendly waiter but the blonde girl did not even care and worked reluctantly.\n",
      "Poor and very fair cuisine, high prices and very slow service.\n",
      "It is a safe bet. A Barcelona classic on the Carmel mountain that does not disappoint. Rustic and warm decoration. Everything is good. I usually order snails, grilled suckling rabbit and cheese flan: impressive. The staff are pleasant and efficient. It's not cheap, but it's worth it. Highly recommended for those who like embers.\n",
      "He eats well, but the service goes very badly. In addition, they do not care about the wine. Two bottles in poor condition. The third, another brand, correct.I recommend the rabbit to the grill. Very tender And the spicy ones.\n",

With an original atmosphere and very attentive and correct staff. Prices ‚Ç¨ 13 for snails, ‚Ç¨ 15 for lamb and ‚Ç¨ 17 for Entrecote. Highly recommended.\n",
      "If you like snails this is not your restaurant. The worst snails I have eaten in my life, change the person who cooks them and buy them in another place, those snails are not worth doing to the llauna. I will never come back\n",

For my taste the place, or what I saw of it, I do not know if there will be more dining rooms, it is a terrace adapted to a fairly rustic dining room ... it is not bad, you can see part of the kitchen (I liked it) and the views. .. I do not know because it was night. The right treatment We ordered a steak, consomm√© and grilled chicken. The entrecot was very good, although the potatoes looked frozen or fried with sunflower oil or ... they were very yellow, the perfect chicken and the disappointing consomm√© ... it looked like bric put in a mud vol ... 5 ‚Ç¨ for that. No thanks ... It would have been forbidden for restaurants to put you cheap boat food and over charged 5 times what it costs 1 lt .... bread with tomato bie, we say we did not want allioli and brought it, evidently what They charged ..

The restaurant employee's explanation is that the reservation does not assure you anything. They left us last while waiting for a table, when they finally gave us a table, they offered us a table inside the premises as the only option. They didn't give us an apology or anything.

      "The cleaning shines by its absence, the tablecloth was full of stains that tried to cover by putting the napkins on top that also had stains. The glass had to change because it was dirty. The waiters were kicking some standard peppers that had fallen to the ground for a long time. The place fills with smoke as soon as they start cooking. We ordered snails from the llauna, the cook went to another room, came out with a plate of snails and put them in the microwave. The baked kid left a lot to be desired, homemade but bland potatoes and seemed overheated with the kid. The sirloin with very good foie (although we were told that they would bring a plate of side dish fries that never came) and the steaks we saw looked good. It is a place to eat meat exclusively. Affordable price. Regular attention I would rate it with 3 stars for the meat but not too much does not compensate.\n",

      "A revelation, pure magic.Three ladies in a tiny kitchen and two big men in the dining room.Beef, lamb, pork, superfine, cooked to perfection, fish, salads with mango and pineapple that marry tomatoes and olives with an embarrassing naturalness .. And one of the best Sangria I've ever had to drink (they make it at the moment by composing the ingredients by eye ... Do you ...).This place is a miracle. Dedicated to the people here, when you book, get yourself understood in Catalan, because they don't know the languages ‚Äã‚Äã.. Fortunately. It is already walled up with people like that ... Perfect prices and by no means expensive.Well done. Well done. I rarely disentangle myself like this, but this place, I repeat, is a miracle. I hope to return to Barcelona soon.

Ferrero Rocher dessert with a spectacular spoon and delicious lemon pie. Very quiet and with few tables. I have seen they have a private room for 4 people at the back of the premises.

Once I left, completing the time they told me, I stayed to see that the table was empty for 15 minutes. I felt very ill and I do not think I would come back.In addition, there is no menu.It is a very assorted letter, but with prices too high. The rice with shrimp was good, but not for the small amount and the price ‚Ç¨ 11.Also, drink it apart.No indication of intolerances and, according to them, must be reserved. A little coach for whom, like me, we do not have a fixed restaurant every day, but we repeat the area. What I have clear is that it will take me a lot to go back.Health!üéó\n",
      "Of those small and little known restaurants where you can eat wonderfully, in addition to having a modern and cozy place. There is no lunch menu but you can have lunch for about 25 ‚Ç¨ things like a fantastic cream of artichokes with foie and nuts or an extraordinarily cooked fish rice and for dessert a goat cheese mousse with berries in the their sauce and cookie. The truth is that they are leafy plants and you can do without dessert or replace the first with a chopping board.Recommended for any gourmet.\n",
      "We ate very well, and well served. You must prepare the escalope trout and foie gras. And the toast of Sta Teresa ... In fact, everything was very good!\n",

      "Delicious food at a great price. They do not have a lunch menu but it is not necessary, it has very low prices.

      "Every day I pass in front of this restaurant, with a semi-Nordic, minimalist and always full design. Finally I decided to try their \"menu of the day\" after having read a lot of good comments on social networks.They have no menu of the day, they have a short but cool menu with first, second and desserts. Of course, the letter changes every week approx.Prices are high executive level. But executive who is operating bikini, because the portions are extremely small. Let's say that the dishes are like the decoration of the place: minimalist, with hardly any garnishes, scarce but of good quality and exquisite taste.The service is normal. With the price range they have, I think it could be improved a lot.I tried the artichoke and sardine coca (a ridiculous), the steak tartar (super simple, 0 side dish) and the rice (spectacular). All very rich, yes, good cuisine, but not equivalent to the price sold.Recommended for fine palates, reduced stomachs and happy bank account.\n",
      "Haute cuisine at a good price\n",
      "Wonderful menu of quality and high level\n",
      "The service should improve a lot. Rest is correct.\n",

      "creative market cuisine of quality but expensive\n",
      "Super good food\n",
      "Good Chinese restaurant, where the two dishes I ordered had quite a remarkable flavor, something unusual in inexpensive oriental restaurants.Of course, do not expect warm attention from the owner, perhaps it is more of a cultural detail, but nothing that prevents you from enjoying typical Chinese food.It has a spacious living room and a terrace with three tables.\n",
      "Homemade fried noodles. Chicken dumplings. Alone. Battering. It seems like I'll wrap it up if I eat one here by myself.Vietnamese cuisine is also available. Menbosha is also sometimes present and absent.\n",
      "Chinese food restaurant, all very rich, tasty and fresh. Very good service and correct prices. It is medium in size, they also have a couple of tables outside. All clean.\n",
      "Very good everything. Great choice at Bar Elina to eat Chinese home cooking.\n",
      "Very rich food and generous portions. The Japanese fried chicken is terrific and the duck fried rice is also delicious. The menu is varied with traditional Chinese dishes.\n",
      "We had previously tried the lunch menu and the truth is that it is always a very good option.This time we chose several dishes from the menu in order to try different things.We started with the prawn guotie, the pork xialongbao and the cold noodle salad with house dressing. (I would ask for the 3 appetizers again without hesitation, especially the guotie and the xialongbao)We continue with the mapo tofu (very good), the noodles with minced meat (we always order them, safe bet) and the duck in sauce (quite good)Finally we tried the sesame ice cream (worst sesame ice cream I have ever eaten) and the matcha tea mochi (it was not bad but they served us totally frozen)Without a doubt, whenever we have been, we have eaten very well, except for the desserts that are best eaten at home or elsewhere. The service is also up to scratch.\n",
      "When it comes to the attention, the food, everything is great. My partner and I went and we ordered 5 dishes in total (edamames, pork guotie, noodles, beef with peppers and duck) and we really liked them. For dessert we ordered an assortment of matcha tea that includes a scoop of ice cream, tiramisu and matcha tea truffles, all very good, but I prefer the tiramisu.What I did not like about my visit is that a group of 6 people arrived and they were allowed to sit together, when the current restrictions due to Covid-19 in Catalonia said that a maximum of 4 people. They play a good fine.\n",
      "Just as it says on its website. A very familiar place.Type of restaurant: CasualPrice: $ for me one of the restaurants with the best quality and lowest price, is one of its strengths.The express lunch menu is 9 euros. I include a noodle soup with meat, bottled beer, and coffee.Attention: good attention as long as I have visited this site.Cleanliness: adequate, overall cleanliness and in the bathrooms.Recommended dishes:Noodle soupPeking style duck.Grilled veal.Of course the always cold Tsingtao beerAn establishment with a new attractive concept where you can spend a pleasant time in good company and good food. Where each dish achieves what is difficult to achieve, the balance in the kitchen between sweet, salty and bitter, even dessert.\n",
      "All very good. All the dishes we have eaten were delicious, balanced, with soft but penetrating flavors. The place is very nice and the staff is fast and very friendly. I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Good Chinese restaurant with a wide variety of dishes. Price not very expensive. There is the menu option (I don't know if it's only during the week).\n",
      "Quick attention, good quantity in the portions.Very good value for money.Clean premises without crowds of peopleDisinfectant gel at the entrance to guarantee security measures.Quality food and to the point.The Guotie were very good, recommended.

      "Well, convenient noon menu. Fast service.\n",
      "High level Chinese food. Request reservation. Safety pin. I want to come back!!!!\n",
      "It is neat and delicious.It is also inexpensive. It is a Chinese restaurant in Barcelona that is within your fingertips.Should I say seafood udon? Seafood udon and meat udon are very delicious.Actually, I like the clean gel\n",
      "Very good food. Good customer service and a beautiful atmosphere. Highly recommended\n",
      "Terrible, we left without waiting for them to bring everything we had asked for. Terribly terrible, poor quality food, perfect for a good Sunday indigestion that frees you from going to work on a Monday\n",
      "The price is normal and looks good. Ordered fried noodles with sauce, mapo tofu, and soy sauce fried rice. The tofu is very tender, but not numb, the fried noodles are very fragrant, but not too saucey. In short, the taste is not bad, and the level of home cooking is quite far from the mainstay. Four-star bar, plus points for environment and service.\n",
      "Incredible place, attention 20 points, the food is delicious highly recommended\n",
      "Typical Chinese - Japanese dishes, some curious, nothing out of the ordinary. But good.\n",
      "The shop was beautiful and the staff were busy, but they were kind to customers.I got shrimp dumplings and shrimp fried rice.Both have a shrimp feeling,It was delicious without the smell of shrimp.The fried rice was a relatively fried rice.The amount was not so much.The second time I got shrimp fried rice, but it was a little oily and my stomach sag after eating.The stir-fried squid was spicy. There were plenty of vegetables.I changed the ‚òÖ to 5 last time, but since the fried rice was sticky, I changed it to 4.\n",
      "If you value your life, don't go. Worst quality food, horrible and run down place. Perfect for getting rid of that tinder date that doesn't go the way you expected\n",
      "We ate delicious! The prawn wok was the best part of the meal. The guy who attended us was very friendly. And for dessert the matcha tiramisu was perfect! I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Really typical Spanish place, very small, family run.From the outside it does not inspire safety but the fish is fresh of the day.The owners don't speak English but we understand each other.Recommended\n",
      "Very good quality!\n",
      "Spectacular bouillabaisse!Great food, generous amounts and more than correct prices. A hidden treasure in poble sec that is worth trying\n",

      "Family restaurant with little capacity, so it is mandatory to make a reservation in advance. Very good market product. Specialty in soupy rice, stew, etc. Recommended.\n",
      "Really well. But I spread it too much. It's very small and we can't fit it in. \"Grilled turbot\", highly recommended\n",
      "A restaurant where if you pass by you would never enter, but its exquisite food, octopus and rice soup for me the best, for me it lacks a chocolate dessert üç´üòãIt was a very special 40th birthday gift üéÇ.\n",
      "‚Ç¨ 45 per head without dessert.The aesthetics of the place is bar-like without any charm and only with 4 tables, if you see it from outside it does not invite you to enter, but the food and the treatment are good.They do not have a menu, only a blackboard with the seafood and fish of the day, but without prices! Which makes you go blind and the bill is always a surprise. The genre is good but the relationship between everything and the final price is not good. I doubt between 3 and 4 *Say that amazing cockles.\n",
      "The Montalb√°n is simply spectacular. If you like seafood absolutely a must. Great sea snails and a wonderful lobster stew, among many others. I wish I had it under my house!\n",

      "Top quality food and exquisite treatment\n",

      "Excellent what we asked for, and the comments from colleagues u value very positively, comment the service good fast and well priced.\n",
      "The lobster stew is impressive, better than in Menorca. Prawns, barnacles, my but the razors, maybe because I don't like them very much. Let them guide you, but don't let the stew escape, by the way, you have to reserve it at least one day before\n",
      "Very good product and service, I will repeat whenever I can.Excellent.\n",

      "For being the first time that I visit this establishment, after having heard very good comments about the Poble Sec neighborhood. I really liked it because of how calm it is eaten and the quality of the raw material, which is what is important. The only thing is the clams, I did not like their preparation, because of the flavor they still had in Albari√±o. Fresh they were. Everything else perfect. Thank you so much for everything.

Pleasant family treatment, expert cuisine and unbeatable product.The decoration is very simple because the food is the protagonist there.The best barnacles I have ever eaten, an excellent fish with little elaboration (as it should be). The garnishes are like the old ones (homemade chips that make you go back to childhood) and padr√≥n peppers like nowhere else.The rice (by engargo) wonderful; and the homemade desserts ... to cry.Reservation is essential.Although all are virtues, I do not give it 5 stars because the space is very small and the chairs not very comfortable.\n",

      "You eat very well\n",
      "A very nice place. The menu is very complete and they also offer a menu. They put gluten-free bread for us and adapted one of the dishes on the menu so that I could eat it despite my intolerances. Very friendly and effective.\n",
      "The attention is very good and the place is well set.We went from the menu, quite affordable 13 euros and very good quality.First we ate some gratin aubergines and second steak and bream.All great, we will repeat.\n",
      "Very nice place to have tapas, hamburgers and sandwiches. Very friendly waiters, the price is very good for Barcelona and everything I have tried (I have been several times) was very tasty. Highly recommended\n",
      "Clean, fast, friendly good atmosphere good quality price only fail for my taste in that they do not strive to speak Catalan and less in English or French as I have observed, in a city as touristy as Barcelona this is basic to start speaking well the language of the land and give good service to foreign tourists.For the rest a highly recommended place.\n",
      "Good option, nice decoration, well balanced menu at ‚Ç¨ 12.90 during the week, fast service.\n",
      "It was all great! We have ordered the menu of the day and the dishes have a good amount of food. The dessert was delicious.\n",

      "It is usual work closeGreat serviceCozyThey would have to vary the tapas\n",
      "It is an ideal place for everything, I have known it for a thousand years, it has undergone a reform that has made it bigger and more beautiful. The attention is always great, the team makes you feel at home, I have to say that the Cuban girl at the bar is a sweetheart and a great professional, people like her are the ones who make you come back to a place. At the green's you can go in the morning for breakfast, one night for a drink, one lunchtime to eat a menu or have a business lunch, one afternoon for a coffee or a beer with a date or with the family, one night to have a good dinner, either tapas or in the first and second plan. Ideal for everyone, great running hours, so you always have it there for when you need it. We will keep coming back a thousand times. Ah, if there are negative reviews, ignore them, they are surely from the competition or from people without criteria.\n",
      "All good enough. Correct value for money.Good terrace.None of the waiters speak Catalan, which we value negatively (but they understand it)\n",
      "I have been going a lot for years, I have it next to my work and I like the value for money although I have to say that after the pandemic the first dishes have dropped in quality, both the paella on Thursdays that always leave the rice quite a bit whole (which is a shame because so far it was one of the best dishes in the restaurant and the flavor is very good) and the crab and pineapple salad in which the crab consists of 3 transparent slices of crab stick (literal) and the pineapple the same, they could put green salad and they would be much better.\n",
      "Excellent lunch menu for ‚Ç¨ 12.90, local well put, I take them to the little star of Catalan (only on demand with smaller print that Spanish).\n",

      "You eat well and the treatment is pleasant by the staff, WE WILL RETURN\n",
      "It is a very well located site. Perfect to eat or drink. There are usually people because of the location and the price of the menu. It is a good value for money place. Good attention and pleasant treatment. Perfect for holding a table I really like the terrace because of its location. There is a parking lot right in front of it. Regarding food, it is a well-cooked and tasty menu for those who like to eat. I will return without a doubt.\n",
      "Excellent service from Willi. A 10.\n",
      "Anti-covid safety rules are skipped on the bullfighter. I went there quite often but I stopped doing it. They have not limited the capacity, crowded tables, little distance of separation ... And even a waiter saying \"The capacity of 30% I pass it through the lining\". I will not go back.\n",
      "I have gone several times for a drink on the terrace, I like the place, it is nice!\n",

      "Good team of waiters (Argentina the best)\n",
      "Good service, modern and with an interesting menu.\n",
      "The service is fine but the food leaves something to be desired. I have gone twice and both times the meat has been immaculate. Expensive for the quality they offer. I attach photos of the menu that day.\n",
      "Anti-covid safety measures are not respected. I used to go there very often, but I stopped doing it because they don‚Äôt meet the capacity allowed on the premises; the tables are full of a lot of people and quite close to each other. I will not go back.\n",
      "No more but very affordable.\n",
      "Good and fast service.\n",
      "Lunch menu Wide, soft lighting which makes it pleasant. Fast noon service. Good food, although desserts can improve. Average price of the area but with somewhat more generous portions than other restaurants around. Correct staff\n",
      "The letter is only in Catalan. They do not even put in Spanish the supplements for each product for eating at a bar / table / terrace (A robbery).I ordered a gourmet hamburger knowing that it was very expensive because it was supposedly foie, but it was just pate. Very very loose and the exorbitant price.I leave photo of the ticket ... Coffee ‚Ç¨ 1.65.The place is nice, but I would not return. In Barcelona there is a wide range of bars and restaurants to make this system work well for you. They should reflect.\n",
      "The waiters are a bit stressed. Food ok.\n",
      "Very good attention, the exquisite meat just at its point, the hummus and the brabas surprise, one hundred percent recommended\n",

      "Excellent place to go to eat with friends, or a work meeting. The food is very rich and well served. Would go back!\n",
      "Very terrible waiters service never, under any circumstances, come to this place, you will spit on your plate. This is the worst place I've been in all of Spain\n",
      "I liked the variety and quality of the menu.The terrace was very nice, the service was very correct. Worth a try\n",
      "The menu is very correct quality price. If they have carrot cream with parmesan, don't ask for it. One of the worst I've ever had. The place and the attention of 10.\n",
      "After 50 minutes of waiting for us to put 4 drinks, not even one was put as it should ... we came here to have a drink before going to dinner elsewhere, and we ended up unhinged with the service and the attention of the place ... of shame!\n",
      "Perfect quality price !! A very correct daily menu! At the tapas level, everything is very good!Advisable 100x 100 !!\n",
      "I recommend üëç\n",
      "Covid measures are not respected. Nafie wears a racist mask with the Catalans. And they charge things that they don't touch. Call FAQUA. I'm not hater but bad vibes\n",
      "Here you have the picture of my account!What is worth ‚Ç¨ 4 is a 33cl bottle of water!That said, all said. 1 star and I do not step on this site again!\n",
      "There is a waitress who has serious mental problems, is bitter and treats her inferiors badly. I am the boss and I used to put her on the street.\n",
      "Good service, great food\n",
      "Great place to go to lunch at noon. The service is very fast, the dishes always good and thought. It is missing some vegetarian option in the seconds of the menu. The delicious desserts.\n",

      "Very good, good experience\n",
      "Good terrace\n",
      "The waiters have given us an excellent treatment. There has been a confusion with the bill, we have commented it to the waiter who has apologized very kindly and has gone to find the manager, who instead of apologizing has spoken to us in very bad ways and without any kind of respect or education. Vengeful the treatment of this person.\n",
      "Good quality food, nice place and friendly workers. Service a bit slow\n",
      "Slow service and only fair food. You pay the price of the place.\n",
      "Very loose\n",
      "Very nice place, good service and very good food. Recommended !!!!!!\n",
      "Good food and enough portions.Correct treatment\n",
      "There is a good quality price relation.Maybe too many people for the moment we're going through.\n",
      "Today I was eating the menu with my uncle and I didn‚Äôt like it at all. The pan was dry and had no lemon, moreover, they did not bring it with the paella.Normal service but nothing out of this world.The only thing that was worth it was the gazpacho and the watermelon.We will definitely not repeat it again.\n",
      "It is expensive but of good quality. The median is worth ‚Ç¨ 2.60. It is a perfect bar to watch football as they project the games on the terrace and have several screens inside the restaurant. Burgers are expensive but very good. The employees are very kind and friendly.Bar / Restaurant highly recommended to watch soccer in the area or to spend the afternoon with friends.\n",
      "Modern restaurant, very attentive and friendly waiters, the very rich but brave potatoes have nothing to look or taste ... the Green's burger for the price is pretty good what to mixed dishes or idea ... I asked for a Italian: scallop, spaghettis and grilled egg.the scallop almost to throw the egg with the undercooked distemper and the spaghetti that was noodles, past and pa topped off I ask the waiter for some bread and they put me for a mini roll 0.95 when it does not come out even in the letter (thieves) and nothing cheap\n",
      "Good menu and very attentive service.\n",
      "A restaurant with a family touch\n",
      "A traditional bar, a lifelong bar, now renovated and expanded, in front of what used to be the Up & Down nightclub. Good tapas. Comfortable terrace\n",
      "Instead of guacamole with nachos, m.han put a bunch of nachos with an avocado microrration. When I said that wasn‚Äôt guacamole, they brought me two micros of chopped onion and pepper. Inmenjable. Only someone who has not really eaten guacamole in their entire life can be confused. A hoax, just like the omelette with potatoes. It is not explained how a restaurant can survive if not for the total lack of gastronomic culture and palate of its customers.\n",
      "I used to go to this bar for a drink but I won't be back for a reason. The guy who attended us this afternoon on the terrace, was most unpleasant ... he seemed to be doing us a favor and giving us bad faces and bad answers. His boss came out for a second and he seemed like another person in front of him ... incredible that they can have such a great person like this man. A pity\n",
      "Very loose. Nachos with guacamole (not the other way around) is better than the market one. Whip sandwich bread like chewing gum. The potato omelette with bread and tomato, regular. And the service ... in the same line. I don't plan to go back. One of many places that unfortunately abound in BCN. More than Green's: Grey's dog-like-run.\n",
      "Correct and in a very comfortable place. A very correct quality and good service.\n",
      "Excellent value for money uptown Barcelona\n",
      "An oasis in barna\n",
      "Quiet and stylish\n",
      "Bar Restaurant. Well decorated. Cozy. Uniformed personnel. Right price. I can't comment on food. I have only had breakfast or a coffee although it looks good. With terrace\n",
      "Good food and very good service\n",
      "The attention and the very good food\n",
      "Friendly and fast\n",
      "Perfect for watching football\n",

      "Good quality\n",
      "Great menu !!! They have adapted great to take away!\n",
      "Restaurant with a terrace that offers good dishes, an acceptable quantity, tasty and well presented.Good attention and good price.\n",
      "Price quality.Correct.\n",
      "They have a menu that is usually very good. The price is correct, the service is very attentive and it is always full at meal times, a sign that it is well received.\n",
      "The waiters an excellent treatment. The lousy manager, a rude one.\n",

      "Reference to the area at breakfast and coffee. The terrace is very good. Inside it smells of air freshener\n",
      "The bravas completely raw, but the rest is very good\n",
      "Excellent to have a good ham and a wine to match. Attentive and professional service. Ideal to sit at night on the terrace for a drink. Good atmosphere and decoration of the irreproachable place.\n",
      "Meeting place for many people during the matches of Barcelona. Very good, very gourmet burgers and very attentive staff.\n",
      "That they add a 15% supplement to each plate for sitting on the terrace in the middle of the Covid pandemic, when you try to adopt security measures, it seems to me, as unethical. Which is not on the beachfront either. Otherwise, regular.\n",
      "Nice, quiet and pleasant place. Good food and good treatment\n",
      "A friendly place, with privacy, in one of the most beautiful areas of Barcelona.\n",
      "Good value for money\n",
      "Good restaurant, somewhat expensive for what they offer.\n",
      "Great place for dinner or a drink. Great terrace.\n",
      "Nice and modern restaurant. The menu of the day for twenty euros was really good and prepared with finesse. Perfect for a good lunch.\n",
      "Wide menu and really good food. Good customer service and fast service. Nice decoration and atmosphere and with a large number of tables available inside as well as outside terrace. Recommended both for lunch and for a drink.\n",
      "The service for groups excellent. Generous dishes, good atmosphere. The attention of the staff very warm. Highly recommended In this case we were a group of 40 people.\n",
      "Menu at noon, for less than ‚Ç¨ 13. Well cooked food and good portions. Fast and friendly waiters.\n",
      "The facilities are very welcoming as is the service. The prices on the contrary are very high for what they offer.\n",
      "I was for work and both the treatment of the staff and the food seemed spectacular to me, almost once I go to Barcelona I will return to this restaurant because I want to try more dishes from their menu\n",
      "Good menu at a reasonable price for what is offered ... ‚Ç¨ 12.5. Also excellent and fast service. Many office people. Menu at 1 means that you come at least five or not get site\n",
      "From the first moment the attention of the manager was cold and unpleasant, without wanting to adequately serve customers. The attention of the waiter Willy was excellent. Friendly and charming. But after we consumed almost 200 euros in drinks, the manager disrespected the users with an attitude not suitable for a restaurant service and with an air of superiority. The restaurant service very good ... but the attitude of the manager ... totally out of place. Regrettable. If I were the owner of this restaurant, I would not want the image of it to be based on this type of staff.\n",
      "Very friendly service\n",
      "Very nice place, the waiters helpful and the barman makes very good cocktails, two Bloody Mary, the second spicier as I mentioned and tremendous. One day we will have to try the food.\n",
      "Good atmosphere with a good and interesting menu.Willy is a crack.\n",
      "Bonisim\n",
      "Service somewhat chaotic, at least the day I was\n",
      "It eats very well, and the treatment is very good\n",
      "Excellent menu of the day. Two dishes, drank and dessert for ‚Ç¨ 12'50. Many options and all of them very rich and of good quality. 100% recommended\n",
      "One of the best bar / restaurant in Barcelona. A place to disconnect and above all to have a good time among friends. I will repeat whenever I can.\n",
      "Very professional. Good product\n",
      "My boyfriend surprised me with this restaurant I didn‚Äôt know and we were really delighted. The tasting menu is absolutely exquisite. A pleasure for the palate and the senses. The attention of the staff is excellent and very professional. The beautiful and cozy restaurant. It has been a delight that we will repeat!\n",
      "A real pleasure for the senses. The tasting menu was an experience that I would not mind repeating. They had the deference to change a dish which my wife could not eat for an alternative that she gave me to envy not having changed as well. The staff were highly attentive and very friendly.\n",
      "Tasting menu that does not leave you indifferent. Each dish is delicious and a gift for the palate, just looking at the photos makes my mouth water again. The price of the menu is very reasonable considering the preparation and quality of each dish. The only suggestion I would make is for the meringue of wines that may put too much in each glass.An unforgettable experience!\n",
      "We chose the tasting menu and we really loved it, the attention was excellent and the place was fresh, clean and with pleasant lighting. Recommended!\n",
      "In itself a fine restaurant, but the atmosphere is distant and not very cosy. Maybe better in the evening. Also a pity that the kitchen is not visible. Overall fine but don't go there 2nd time.\n",
      "Delicious üòä very original dishes, exquisite flavors and very good presentation of the dishes, a unique experience.I recommend it and I will repeat for sure.Many thanks to the very friendly staff and chef all.\n",
      "Local with a very careful image, friendly and efficient staff. We ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing, it was a real pleasure to taste it with wonderful flavors and aromas. I hope it won't take long to repeat\n",
      "Impeccable service very attentive. Highly recommended tasting menu.\n",
      "Delicious experience, all delicious, undoubtedly honor the category.We have ordered a very complete lunch menu, all excellent dishes.Very friendly and attentive service.Very cozy and comfortable place to enjoy food.I recommend it without a doubt, quality price very correct.I would repeat without hesitation.\n",
      "A great experience, a continuous enjoyment for the palate. To highlight the wild hake with truffle and artichoke, spectacular! Service a 10, we will be back shortly!\n",
      "It can be recommended\n",
      "We ordered the gourmet menu to go. Attentive service and fluent communication.Expensive shipping price. 12 euros for outside of Barcelona and 10 in Barcelona city.Good dishes. The bad thing is that the indications are very scarce, they do not explain that before heating you remove the flowers and decorations since in the microwave they spoil and disappear and the dish cannot be presented well.It would be better if you could plate your at home with its indications with the decorations in separate containers.We will try the restaurant at another time.We went back to the restaurant and the score is the same. Bad service. Pairing with hardly any explanation. We did a tasting menu. Very nice presentations and good food. Excessive reference to beets.We would have liked more variety. And the service of course. In menus of 75 euros per person you expect a service of 10.\n",
      "When professionalism is combined with experience, a great restaurant is a place where while you eat, your head boils with ideas. Congratulations Jordi.\n",
      "Very good product, good service, imaginative dishes and brilliantly executed and presented. If I have to put a glue, is that, at this level, where they have a wine of 1,600 ‚Ç¨ a la carte, they offer a beer that you find in the supermarket for one euro. At least one Orval was waiting for me. The sommelier has to do work when it comes to quality beer.\n",
      "There is nothing like good food, I have gone to eat from a furancho to a restaurant with Michelin stars like this one and you could not find a single one but even if you looked for it. An attention worthy of a local with a cache, a pleasant atmosphere with space to enjoy the food and the experience.The food is a pampering, a job and an elaboration under the techniques of a very professional team.I'll be back is a safe bet.\n",
      "Place worthy of 1 Michelin star. For my taste I would only change the type of bread. For the rest the raw material and very correct service. And I have also had the pleasure of meeting chef Jordi Esteve. I'll be back for sure. Thanks\n",
      "Good care and excellent food.\n",
      "We thoroughly enjoyed the experience was spectacular! üíØ!Its traditional cuisine with a modern imaginative and modern touch.The combination of innovation and tradition is one of the restaurant's best secrets.This magnificent combination makes it a benchmark for restoration in Barcelona.Excellent wine list.Calm and very cozy atmosphere.The staff is very kind and professionalWe will be back very soon!Very highly recommended üíØ\n",
      "Perfect. From the service, the food, the preparation of the dishes, the presentation. The crockery is also beautiful. The portions, very correct. The rice, awesome. Surely we will be back for some special celebration.\n",
      "Food of \"design\", but in my opinion something was missing, I would not know what to say for good or bad.Of course, a quiet place, you can talk and they take care of you very well.\n",
      "The first Michelin one star. Michelin seems to be right after considering all the different factors.A house that seems to have gained more points in other parts than taste.\n",
      "It is a pleasure to enjoy this restaurant, to its exceptional cuisine is added the very pleasant attention from a trained, friendly and attentive staff. A 10 place for any pocketbook. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Spectacular food for unforgettable moments\n",
      "Incredible experience! Service of 10, food of 10, the place is updated with the Covid, we will return\n",
      "Correct service, good compliance with anticovid measures. We chose a lunch menu. Starters with very good presentation, but little salmon taquito. The bread with very good oil, they offer you to repeat.The salad of different textures, the best; with delicious tomato trompe l'oeil.The rice, passable.I would offer another dessert option for those who do not like red fruits.You end up with 2 little delicacies, one coconut and one chocolate.Good experience.\n",
      "Very good restaurant I ate a lot of taste !! very special dishes pro bunisimsCome back !!\n",
      "What to say about Nectari? A wonderful place, what you can eat there almost makes you cry, it is pornfood as some would say !!! Do not stop trying it because it is really worth it! Apart from the good treatment, the food is too much !!! We will repeat, as always in sites of this caliber! Gr√†cies per tot, it has been a pleasure for the palate !!! Arreveure, salut !!!I leave a picture of the dessert! A delight!\n",
      "The experience has been very good the menu of the day very complete and the excellent service. It shows that I had a Michelin star. We went from Madrid because they had recommended it to us. Recommendable!!\n",
      "The weekday menu is ‚Ç¨ 35 with very good value for money. We will be back for sure we were very pleasantly surprised!\n",
      "We loved the experience! The food is delicious and the service excellent\n",
      "I found it very good, friendly and helpful staff, dishes presented in a wonderful way. I took the tasting menu, excellent food quality, the only flaw is that the first three dishes are mostly creams then in liquid substance and are heavy one after the other.\n",
      "A good restaurant in the left Eixample. Tasting menu with a very good quality price\n",
      "Eat a lot of quality. Treat me exquisitely Very friendly and very professional service. Very highly recommended for having a gastronomic experience more than interesting.\n",
      "Very good restaurant. Very correct treatment and very good food. The only downside would be the outdated d√©cor and elevator music. We made the menu half a day and finished enough tips! Want to try more!\n",
      "Very good food and very good service from all the team of waiters. I recommend it.üëåüç¥üëç\n",
      "Top site in Barcelona. Half-day menu very good and varied. The best starters more than the main dishes\n",
      "I like all the exquisite food I recommend it\n",
      "Excellent lunch menu for ‚Ç¨ 35\n",
      "Excellent, recommended üíØ. A Venezuelan girl attended us very well, pleasant and impeccable at all times. The food with very intense flavors on the palate, pleasant textures, perfect combinations in aromas, plating and presentation with a good touch, full portions, the rice portion is large until you can share it. The desserts have left memory on my palate has been the best, they were very rich (we ordered some strawberries 0 and burguer brownie), the atmosphere is very intimate for a dinner. Both food and desserts have snacks.\n",
      "Impressive fusion of flavors. Exceptional service. We will repeat for sure. Great experience .\n",
      "We really enjoyed it, a unique experience that is well worth it. The service was unbeatable, great personal attention, exquisite food, great presentation. Many congratulations to the chef, to whom we were able to say hello and thank you for the dinner. Absolutely recommended.\n",
      "Very well-taken care of food, combination of incredible flavors and a wine list more than interesting. I can not give you a 5 because a restaurant in this category has to give a round service, but it was not like that, shortly after commenting with the friendly waitress that they did not eat the appetizers, among them croquettes of pularda, I understand that they would have to have brought an alternative after having indicated my preferences. The theme of the crockery should also be more careful, a gazpacho served on a plate with irregular bottom is difficult to eat, were a couple of spoonfuls on the plate that could not be finished. With the pre-dessert they brought some forks to eat the excellent beet infused with lime that they served, but that, once used, there was no where to deposit them without staining the linen cloth. They also made a mistake in the account and we had to request that they bring it again, which they did at the time, it could be a dinner of 10 and was left in less, totally recommendable and with quality food and cooked in an original way, but with failures that should not exist in a restaurant with that level of cuisine and a Michelin star. Meal of 10, service of 9.\n",
      "Wonderful dinner! The staff made the evening even more enjoyable. Dinner 10. Thanks for everything!\n",
      "Tenderness and intimacy are the keywords of this little place, excellent in the attention to detail, in the very loving attention and at no time heavy, the suggestive presentation of very good food and the cava prepared especially for them and labeled With the name of the Nectari restaurant, all that turns any visit into a vital moment of pleasure for which one feels grateful. The restaurant is hiding in a quiet street and the interior is modestly decorated, but the real luxury is being able to enjoy a conversation and a gastronomic experience in total harmony. The chef comes out to say hello and is charming.\n",
      "If you are looking to enjoy a gastronomic place without having to make a large outlay, this could be a very good option since this restaurant offers a tasting menu option for 35 euros that has nothing to envy to any other star, with very complex dishes. and an excellent deal\n",
      "An exquisite place. Very good food. I recommend the tasting menu 100%.\n",
      "Well deserved Michelin star, brutal food and exquisite service. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Bueeeno ... Not bad, but it doesn't kill ...Old-fashioned place, perforated tablecloths, more cheeky than it should be ...\n",
      "Restaurant with a Michelin Star. I tried the tasting menu. The dishes are visually spectacular but they are also brutally good. High quality raw materials and products and a chef who does an extraordinary job. The photos I refer to. Although the price is high, it is well worth it. Try it ... you won't be disappointed. The treatment of staff is excellent. Highly recommended !!!\n",
      "Exquisite food and very friendly staff.\n",
      "Spectacular ‚Ç¨ 45 menu, signature cuisine that does not neglect the quantity, with perfect attention.\n",
      "Nectari home pitiful. Look at the photos and the steak tartare is not even 1/2 cm high and the rest equal. They screwed up my New Year's Eve dinner. The explanation they have given me is that they are portions, because that is warned and for the price of portions nothing. A shame!\n",
      "Delicious!\n",
      "High-quality site with very elaborate dishes, perfect attention too, quiet atmosphere ideal for couples or a dinner with some privacy, it is worth what you pay. No complaint about it\n",
      "Very good service with quality cuisine\n",
      "Nice, good service, friendly and professional, very good food and well presented, very successful wine pairing. recommendable\n",
      "Possibly one of the best restaurants in town. And the best rice I've ever had. 100% recommendable.Noon tasting menu for 39 euros, drink apart, is a gift for the senses. Nevertheless, it has a Michelin Star.Close but exquisite service, unsurpassed main dishes and details typical of a consummate foodie. Taste. And a lot!Also noteworthy are the desserts.Laura, Barcelona Local Guide.\n",
      "We ate the truffle tasting menu, I can not even write the delicacy of each dish, there are things that the words cannot describe. The service is impeccable and the experience incomparable. Even the bathroom draws attention to how beautiful it is.We had the truffle tasting menu, there are no words to describe that level of deliciousness. The service is impeccable and the experience hard to match. Even the bathroom is too beautiful not to mention.\n",
      "The place is average and does not indicate at all the entrance to the culinary paradise inside.What a tasting menu my God. Much better than others with much more names in Barcelona.Expensive like everyone but amazing all food experiences. They have a tasting menu for guiris (ham and various Iberian cliches) but the good one is \"the other one\". Expensive but worth it without a doubt. Accompany it with wines that are many and good (even for those who do not like wine).We recommend 100%!\n",
      "Ordinary Michelin restaurant, although characteristic, the food is sweet, not my dish. The chef is very attentive and asks about the dishes one by one.\n",
      "Excellent Mediterranean cuisine,\n",
      "A small restaurant, with a simple and at the same time cozy and pleasant decoration, especially at night and with Christmas decoration.The presentation of the dishes as well as the quality of the product are very good.To highlight the small starters and the \"petit fours\" which are great.The friendliness, good treatment and professionalism of the person in the room is an added value to the room.We were looking forward to being able to do the tasting menu!\n",
      "Fantastic restaurant, we asked for the tasting menu with pairing and it was a success.Friendly treatment of the staff and very attentive at all times.\n",
      "You eat well. But by covid regulations at 5:00 p.m. you have to be out. Courage that there is less\n",
      "Very good food, it is a fantastic gourmet experience\n",
      "Absolutely excellent food, although the bouillabaisse was overly itchy. The staff who serve at the table have very uneven training and education, some must be learning but if so, there should be someone to guide them. It is not normal to forget part of the name of the dish or to ask \"Have you paid?\", So badly pronounced, when you ask for the jacket.\n",
      "Michelin star quality!I have to confess that it is not one of the Michelin stars that moved me the most, but it has exquisite cuisine led by chef Jordi Esteve that is worth visiting. The treatment is excellent at all times.The dishes are very stylish.As an aperitif, I had Yuca Chips and some delicious breads of different flavors and accompanied by an excellent olive oil.The next appetizers were the Cauliflower Aire with Crispy Bacon and Truffle, and the Bloody Mary, both very good.Of starters:- Mediterranean spice croquettes, correct- Game and foie mousse with port reduction and \"petazetas\", this dish is impressive- Cream of seasonal mushrooms and black truffle, very good without a doubtFor the main course, I tried an old beef sirloin with potato parmentier, deliciousAnd the best without a doubt the dessert tribute to Sant Jordi !! What a dessert show !!! I loved it, Excellent !!!!!!!!! What a presentation and what an execution !!!It had strawberry, syrup, mousse, chocolate, macaron‚Ä¶.The strawberry dipped in sublime chocolate !!!!! It reminded me of my trip to Belgium where we had some great ones but this one was even better !!To finish the excellent meal, a Petit four of brownie filled with white chocolate.Deserved Michelin star !! You will enjoy in Nectari!\n",
      "Excellent restaurant, the menu is spectacular the service out of seriesüëè\n",
      "For lovers of tasty dishes, they will not be disappointed. The only detail for the most demanding is that the hot dish was almost warm, otherwise, it's fine. The cozy place, the very courteous staff, and the value for money more than correct.\n",
      "Poor service, charmless setting, small premises, excessive price, good ingredients used, and average quality of food execution.\n",
      "Well-deserved Michelin star\n",
      "Great service and magnificent dishes, adapted to celiacs. Proportional price When eating\n",
      "Fantastic treatment, exceptional food and a pleasant atmosphere\n",
      "Very well-kept cuisine. FANTASTIC RICE! üòã\n",
      "Excellent, productazo and the hand of Jordi Esteve magnificent and the cannelloni of two meats and the rooster of San Pedro to remember. To return and to be delighted.\n",
      "Very elaborate proximity cuisine with some innovative touches. Wine list also worthy of a Michelin star, prices according ... Local somewhat austere but worth the visit. We will be back.\n",
      "I usually order food after class and it is very tasty.\n",
      "Nice place, the rice with brutal shrimp tartare !!!!\n",
      "Great experience! No complaints ! Well done to the chef!\n",
      "We went from the lunch menu and we loved it. They are ‚Ç¨ 40 per person but it is worth it for a special occasion\n",
      "Unusual .. Tasty but expensive\n",
      "We have been having lunch there one weekday. We made the lunch menu for ‚Ç¨ 35. All dishes very well including the initial tapas and petit fours. The seafood rice with prawns was sublime.Looking forward to doing the tasting menu again. Drinks and coffees not included in the menu, at restaurant price of this level.\n",
      "I visited it about 6 or 7 years ago a couple of times, when it got a Michelin star. In this 2020 I have tried their Home Letter service at Christmas. Everything arrived hot, well presented and ready to serve\n",
      "I loved it! A surprising and delicious lunch menu at a very tight price, to have a Michelin star. 100% recommended. We will be safe!\n",
      "The lunch menu is not expensive because they provide quantity and good quality food. The chef came out to greet us, which is always appreciated. I haven't tried the tasting menu yet but as I plan to return ...\n",
      "Great experience. Local with all security measures in our new normal. Adequate environmental music. Very friendly, attentive service, and explaining in detail the dishes we had chosen. The food very good, with a combination of very successful flavors. Recommendable.\n",
      "Wonderful. We loved it. Exquisite and professional treatment.\n",
      "Very good food and extraordinary treatment\n",
      "First of all say that we will return !. Now we go with the criticism ... The excellent food, the times between good dishes and the very good explanations, without tricks. We ate the tasting menu with pairing and it did not disappoint us at all, but concepts that \"look bad\" could be polished: charge ‚Ç¨ 10 for bread, ‚Ç¨ 10 for two canes at the beginning or ‚Ç¨ 6.90 for two coffees! Perhaps it is more attractive to pay ‚Ç¨ 10 more for the menu / person than to see these things reflected at exorbitant prices in the note.\n",
      "Spectacular tasting menu.\n",
      "Spectacular 5 star menu! Essential visit.\n",
      "Every time we go we are very satisfied in terms of attention and very good food, very exquisite. It is very close to home and I love it.\n",

      "Marvelous! Hearty portions, very good flavors, very soft meat, everything very good.The meat, luxury. Remember to ask the waiter for recommendations if you are not sure.The Catalan cream, one of the best!You have to go back and hungry to enjoy more.Very friendly and helpful staff. A great experience.\n",
      "Fantastic! Here I felt like I was experiencing real Spain / Catalonia. The food is excellent, the atmosphere is authentic, the service and the whole restaurant are very pleasant, natural. Prices very ok. I recommend. May this level last as long as possible. Thanks to Michal Hromas from Radio Wave for the recommendation\n",
      "Excellent treatment. They have a menu on Sundays of 35 euros all inclusive. I recommend from the menu. First they put a very complete salad and table of Iberian sausages. In the second there is to choose steak or rice with lobster. If you go on a menu I recommend the suckling pig\n",
      "I was walking through Gran de Gracia, looking for a place to dine, I was struck by its name and decoration. But beyond that, I found a quiet, pleasant and above all very familiar environment.Varied menu and good price. I tried the escalibada with goat cheese, and the sirloin ... exquisite !!Jose and Jordi, more than taken care of, I felt accompanied. Thank you very much, it will surely be one of my favorite restaurants.100% recommended\n",
      "The average place .. the food there are better places to eat and for the same price menu 11e. . The splash. Without flavor a little waste and on top of lettuce ... the escalopin. Cold dried potatoes flavorless pepper sauce the hard and dry meat can be seen in the picture the regular Catalan cream the service is not to rave about, I do not see measures or cleaning of the tables .. I hope they improve.\n",
      "A hidden treasure in the Gracia neighborhood, the exquisite lunch menu at a good price, good personal treatment. I have repeated several times, highly recommended.\n",
      "Second day in Barcelona ... we went to this restaurant before visiting Gaudi's casa vicens' .. we took a tourist menu at 20 euros per person ... which included an excellent carpaccio with parmesan .. a second course of meat .. \"tender asada corte argentino '.. it is a nice piece of braised meat accompanied with mashed potatoes .. pumpkin and aubergine in the oven .. served on a pan with its cooking broth .. excellent .. but very heavy. I suggest you have lunch first and visit after lunch ü§£..the menu also includes a creme brulee..which in my opinion was excellent .. similar to the French creme brulee ... the drinks are apart..I recommend the cava sangria .. a white sangria .. lighter and fresher ... excellent! .. the place is nice .. well cared for. and open kitchen ... very kind staff .. recommend !!\n",
      "Good food, excellent service by some waiters, duly polite by others, portions at extreme savings, high prices, too much for the volume of dishes served.In Barcelona you will find bars on the same level with the right portions and also with lower prices.I don't think I'll be back ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. As far as it is interesting.\n",
      "Impeccable service, the half-day menu at a very good price.\n",
      "Restaurant located in the Gracia neighborhood. A classic in the area. It has spacious Market Kitchen rooms and quality products. The waiters are very professional and attentive. They comply with Covid19 regulations.\n",

      "one of the best places i have been. I am Mexican living in Spain for 2 years now and this has been one of the best places with Spanish gastronomy. excellent quality, more than excellent treatment and excellent quantity. It may be a bit high in price but is well worth it considering flavors and quantities. highly recommended\n",
      "The lunch menu is great for the price\n",
      "Good value for money. Attentive and very correct waiters.You can order a menu or a letter, not very extensive but correct.Specialty in grilled meats, chicken and vegetables.Atypical place.It can be repeated.Parking nearby.\n",

      "Very good value for money, well treated product and both the local and the waiters very nice\n",
      "Local very large and charming although it depends on the area there was more or less light. Both the quality of the food and the quantity is correct, it can be improved since the sole and the lamb were a bit dry. Very good desserts, they teach you a sample book instead of the letter and so you know exactly what you ask for. It is not too expensive. The service is quite fast and attentive.\n",
      "Nice place for lunch or dinner.\n",
      "Very well taken care of, very good value for money\n",
      "All right, the manager is a bit of a bully with the employees, he should take a human resources course.\n",
      "All perfect waiter service. .. and the spectacular food\n",
      "Each day of the day has a menu at ‚Ç¨ 11. It is a bit industrial because it is huge and has to be attended by a lot of people. However, the queue was fast enough and lunch too\n",
      "It's worth Thursday's paella. Cheap menu but very correct\n",
      "Great food at a good price.The place is very nice and friendly\n",
      "Perfect place to always get together in a healthy way. With friends and family and enjoy good food. Super friendly staff. Without a doubt, a reference site in Barcelona.\n",

      "Good service, nice picture\n",
      "It is a good place to eat traditional cuisine, especially meats. The quantities are generous, the product is good and they are well cooked. You can also order to take home. I especially recommend the roast chicken, the potatoes al caliu, the escalivada and the sausage with \"dry\".\n",
      "I don't give more stars because there aren't any.We had dinner as a couple and we couldn't finish happier.To start, we ordered a chicken soup to share that was delicious. It had noodles and chicken inside.We ordered a cheese board that comes with walnuts and quince jelly bread, and it was perfect.Second we ate entrecote. You can see the quality of the meat, juicy and tender, accompanied by GIANT French fries. And padr√≥n peppers, which gave us a good dose of laughs when we touched a spicy couple.For dessert we ordered cheescake and carrot cake, pastry quality.And, despite everything described, the best thing was not the food but the service.They definitely make you feel at home, entertain you with dinner and make you want to stay all night.Highly recommended.\n",
      "Very rewarding experience, very attentive staff and delicious food\n",

      "A truly delicious meal, in a typical and warm place. The service was top notch, we had a great time!\n",
      "A well-decorated place, attentive staff and food that is more than acceptable in quality / price ratio. The lunchtime menu that I have tried is at the level of the locals in the area. Although it is not exquisite (I remember again that it is worth ‚Ç¨ 12.75) it strikes a very good quality. I was surprised that the waiter cared so much that the food was to our liking. I really do recommend this place. I would repeat without hesitation.\n",
      "Very good value for money. Miserable rations of food, enough to fill you up. Spacious site and complies with covid restriction rules. Distance between tables and friendly staff with masks. Beautiful and elegant establishment, well designed and replaced.\n",

With three rooms: outdoor terrace quite small, indoor dining room quite large and indoor terrace with heating quite large as well.The value for money is quite well adjusted.They have a menu with a well-balanced assortment and a small menu with dishes of the day.Adapted and spacious premises. Space between tables, clean and organized.Highly recommended, we had already come and will be back for sure\n",
      "We have been several times, this time it was a group meal to celebrate the birthday of a friend to whom we had commented that it was a good place to eat.We ordered the esqueixada, original and very good. Squid frying, a classic that they do very well. And chicken sticks, simpler but good. And as main courses, rice with secret and porcini and another with chicken and jowls, both very tasty and well done. We also ordered some grilled squid that went with quinoa and vegetables for one of the people who has a lot of food allergies. The truth is that when he commented on it, they offered him various side options, although the mushrooms that were finally put in he said they were not worth much. And finally the desserts, all delicious and with a great presentation.It is a place where for about ‚Ç¨ 30 per person you eat very well and leave happy and full. I also want to emphasize that in a year they have maintained prices, a fact that stands out as the dynamics of many establishments have gone in recent times.And we cannot fail to mention the charming and attentive staff.A site that you have saved on your agenda for any occasion.\n",
      "We went to eat and the truth is that we really liked it. We will repeat for sure. Recommended the squid and the couland filled with white chocolate\n",

      "Very good place to dine, especially groups. Good food and the treatment of the spectacular and super friendly waiters.\n",
      "We ate three for about ‚Ç¨ 40. And that we ask for a supplement (the free-range starry eggs). We ate in 30 minutes! They are very fast as well as serving delicious dishes!It is a perfect place to go with family, friends or your coworkers. Being surrounded by a place with a lot of vehicle traffic, being inside the restaurant isolates you from all that noise and stress. The service takes good care of you and they are very friendly. They are clean and the services are proof of that.\n",
      "Perfect location next to the Gran V√≠a Shopping Center and the Fira de Barcelona. I liked the interior of the place and the very good food. Very kind and friendly waiters. The lunch menu is very good with a good quality / price ratio. I will certainly repeat.\n",
      "I always like to return to where I have been happy ... I love this restaurant, its location, its care in dealing with the customer and its menu ...Since I went I fell in love with Lourdes, she has an exquisite attention. I always come back üòú\n",
      "Overall very good! The seafood paella was very good. I also tried the bravas and squid and in general everything was very tasty. On the terrace it is very comfortable and the waiters are very pleasant.\n",

      "We loved it!!The very nice place, the food very good and a good quantity and the price too.Two people have dinner with good food for ‚Ç¨ 48.\n",
      "Modern place, too bad you have to pick up the cocktails at the bar and pay for them before you sit down\n",
      "I loved it, very good food and excellent treatment by the waiters. I really liked having the opportunity to have lunch there during the training days.\n",
      "A nice place with ample interior space and in a pleasant environment. Too bad the waitresses have so little desire to work.While they take your order, they leave to greet another client ... a great example of attention and when preparing chairs and tables on the terrace I would beg not to be thrown / dropped and less dragged, it is a matter of education, for the noise that it entails and for the bad image they give. I hope to return soon and have a better experience.\n",
      "Unfortunately we were sent back at 6:30 p.m. with the stipulation that the kitchen is closed, a short time later we passed the restaurant again and saw people eating inside. We were also banned from smoking on the terrace even though people smoked at the table next to us. There were eight of us, so they would certainly have paid well too\n",
      "Ideal restaurant when you go to the theater because it is in front of you, they are already used to the fact that at the end of the session at about two quarters of an hour people go to dinner. We were very kindly attended by the waitress Lorena, just a recommendation, which took a long time between dishes, but we understood that it was normal because a lot of people came in from the theater at once. Large and very nice place, well set, decorated with wine bottles, boxes, etc.The right food theme is a franchise that has 7 restaurants, on the island of Diagonal, Diagonal Mar, Gran Via 2, Finestrelles, Splau and √Änec Blau in Castellfefels.First we ate:Broken eggs with foie and Pedro Ximenez (‚Ç¨ 8.70)Grilled vegetables on the grill (‚Ç¨ 7.95).Salmon Tartare (‚Ç¨ 10.95).Seconds:Duck Magret (‚Ç¨ 12.85)Iberian Secret with Pedro Ximenez Sauce (10.95).Dessert:Chesscake with red fruits (‚Ç¨ 8.25).The wines one white Ravent√≥s Pansa Blanca d‚ÄôAlella (‚Ç¨ 17.95) and one red Mineral del Montsant (‚Ç¨ 18.95).I recommend it if you are in the area.\n",
      "We went yesterday with a Smartbox gift voucher to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we were delighted. Cozy place, friendly staff, good food and excellent service. Without a doubt we will repeat. Thank you.\n",
      "The food has been excellent, not only in quantity, especially in quality. Three pieces (starter + main + dessert) for 35 euros including drink. Great recommendation for the paella. But what has made it an excellent visit has been, without a doubt, thanks to our waitress Monica. His good treatment, closeness, recommendations, attention and pampering to the client have been perfect. Five stars for the food, and five stars for Monica.\n",
      "Highly recommended. The attention of the very friendly waiters and the abundant and quality food. We went for a Smartbox and we really loved it.\n",
      "Restaurant in front of the T√≠voli Theater where you can have tapas a little before the 9:00 p.m. session. Very attentive and friendly staff, tastefully decorated and with the correct tapas in terms of quantity, quality and price. What we liked the most were the desserts.\n",
      "A menu of 10 with unbeatable attention. Without a doubt a great discovery in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwe will return for sure. Thank you so much for making us feel at home, Monica! üòç\n",
      "Ideal for lunch or dinner ... the food for 10 and very varied with vegan options .. and great value for money! And the very nice and friendly waiters ... they took great care of us!\n",
      "The truth is, I never usually leave bad reviews, being a doctor who owns a business myself, I realize that you cannot always please the client, however today I have the need to leave this review, today I was a victim of what I felt as discrimination towards me, since my husband and I arrived, a rude man attended us, annoyed because I asked him what his suggestion of a dish was, 20 minutes later a waitress approaches to ask us what our order had been since They had not passed it, 45 min later our dishes arrive (cold and wrong) the truth is I do not think this is acceptable for any restaurant, besides everything it was our anniversary and my husband told me when leaving the restaurant that he had asked this same mr. A detail in the dessert to which he refused, I would not recommend this lousy restaurant to anyone who crosses Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãespecially to Mexicans, apparently in the eyes of this mr. We do not deserve the same treatment, let alone we will have to repeat our anniversary dinner üòÖ.\n",
      "Very well presented. Very friendly and sweet in the treatment. A big and beautiful place ... they charge you at the table. Only if you're in a hurry, it doesn't go so well, because it's really too big! Beautiful room and spacious bathroom on the ground floor! üòâ\n",

      "I was delighted with everything: from the presentation of the dishes, their taste, and the price of the menu, to the warmth of the decoration of the premises, affordable prices and perfect and professional coordination.Everything is delicious, both the salmon and the veal vacuum that we have ordered.In the attached photo the icing on the cake, the dessert.\n",
      "Good service from the waiters, cozy place\n",
      "Very good and varied food, a very quiet atmosphere and the place could not be more beautiful. We will repeat for sure!\n",
      "Delighted with the restaurant. We went with a smartbox and we got a snack and a main course plus dessert. Quality food and very attentive and pleasant staff.\n",
      "Well presented, looks appetizing but unfortunately overcooked steak and burger without sauce (an oversight apparently).\n",
      "Good quality and good prices. Nice atmosphere and romantic touch. Very fast attention.\n",
      "Nice local, charming workers and good quality and well prepared food, I will return.\n",
      "The definition of a culinary disaster.Quasi I left there to go to the police station and file a complaint for mistreatment against the client but also against the staff of this restaurant!Jokes aside, the person who \"runs\" this site is basically a tyrant having the \"God Complex\", but without any talent ...If it was only the 50 minutes waiting for our food and the unkindness of the \"boss\" throwing the plates on the table, it would only have been unpleasant.But our \"beef tenderloin with foie gras and puree\" had been transformed into a piece of meat without foie with fried potatoes (see photo)!Good thing we have humor.I do not understand how this site can remain open ...And poor waitresses, good luck!\n",
      "It is quite good to disconnect a bit from the city. The atmosphere is very quiet and the place is very spacious and comfortable. The portions are good although they are not super abundant. Ideal for sharing.Fair quality / price.\n",
      "Cozy place, good location. Quality of menus, and excellent personal treatment. Highly recommended quality price.\n",
      "What a service disaster, they got plates wrong 3 times in a table of 4.The description of the dishes on the menu has little to do with reality, for example, the candied pineapple with star anise and cheese mousse, were 5 pieces of canned pineapple with fresh cheese on top. What a horror of place.\n",
      "We went to dinner last night for the first time. We were met by a very nice guy in a black shirt who treated us very well and recommended some of the dishes of which they were all very good. Overall all the staff very friendly and professional. Clean, nice place and very good food. We will repeat!\n",
      "In the heart of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãnext to Passeig de Gracia. I was surprised, it is large, very beautiful, very clean, the waiters are friendly. Abundant, quality and Mediterranean cuisine. The price is very affordable. I recommend it. Attending a show and then having dinner at this restaurant is a fantastic experience.\n",
      "The place is beautifully decorated and very cozy. The waiters are always attentive to the tables and the value for money is very well adjusted. No place, a good place to eat.\n",

      "Excellent service and quiet place\n",
      "Everything is very good, very good price to be on Christmas Day, the Cod with sanfaina and all i Oli very little quantity, otherwise everything was very tasty, the starters were very good, the guacamole I would crush it more for my taste. Otherwise good presence, good service and good restaurant. We ate very well.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant, I went with a friend on Saturday to eat and we were delighted with the variety and very good food, a very beautiful place and the best treatment makes you feel at home. And the price is quite good for such high quality 100% recommended.\n",
      "The place is beautiful, the camaraderie well the only thing the food a bit cold\n",

      "It eats very well and is well served in a very central location in the big city but very quiet.\n",
      "Very good place, good service and excellent dishes.\n",
      "We had lunch there. Delicious and affordable food. We ordered different dishes from the menu: paella (mar y tierra); cod and truffle risotto accompanied by a bottle of wine and carbonated for the children. The desserts are also delicious. Good service, good service and good price. Pleasant environment. There is a good chance we will be back.\n",
      "This restaurant is located next to Passeig de Gr√†cia. It is an elegant, modern place with a sophisticated touch.I have always gone to eat daily menu, it is very good and has a good price. The only downside is that the quantities are a bit fair, otherwise it is good value for money.\n",
      "Nice and spacious place, with good acoustics. Attentive and friendly service. The food in the line of the other Casa Carmen. 100% recommended, for now I have not been disappointed.\n",
      "We went last year and this year we have returned. Very well attended, very good genre and very good everything. (And the dogs have been brought water) which is greatly appreciated. Thanks.\n",
      "Very well set but poorly soundproofed. Very well uniformed waiters but they failed a lot at our table both advising and service.Delicious and very well presented dishes, although for my taste they are somewhat scarce.Very correct and well priced menu.\n",
      "Quality price and quantity very well. The waiters are super friendly and cool. I recommend it.\n",
      "Excellent value for money, carefully prepared dishes, a very pleasant waiter and a setting worthy of a starred restaurant.A very good time for a more than correct addition.\n",
      "From ITALIAN, welcoming and elegant place, very kind and nice staff, good and quality food, honest price: Family of 4 tapas, 4 seconds 4 desserts and coffee 100 ‚Ç¨RECOMMENDED!!\n",
      "Spain TravelI regret it once. It's rarely delicious.I didn't ask if I forgot to grill the steak. So if you cut a star and sangria one, it appears in a huge cup. This is what you ordered two sangria. Fried shrimp salad and squid tempura\n",
      "A great discovery. Everything excellent: the area, the attention, the decoration and the dishes. All great and very complete portions.I totally recommend it.\n",
      "The perfect service and food surprised me positively and so did the perfect room\n",
      "An excellent address, attentive, pleasant, helpful, willing and cheerful waiters. The value for money is unprecedented and the restaurant setting is simply magnificent. We have the impression of dining in a starred restaurant but, surprise! without the exorbitant price that goes with it! Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to taste their dessert menu because already satiated by my delicious plate. However, I still had a small place for a cup of coffee con leche and even this little touch at the end of the meal was delicious! It is absolutely necessary to make a jump there!\n",
      "Terrible service. They made a mistake in several dish orders, they put chicken curry on a vegan menu. The bread included in the menu was put with the desserts and why they were remembered. The dessert pineapple confit with star anise and fresh cheese mousse is a joke, it is a can of pineapple chunks and cut chunks from Burgos de Arias. The secret was good.\n",
      "A beautiful place with a very good variety. We ordered some snack dishes and a dinner plate. It was all great! And the attention was very good.\n",
      "I went with my friend who lives in Barcelona.Barcelona has a menu Delia like lunch specialties in almost every restaurant. (Ask the staff!)The restaurant is open for lunch from 2-4 o'clock and menu delia is available until 1-4 o'clock.I had a menu delia, with tuna salad, pork dish ice cream and beer at 12.8 ‚Ç¨.My friend cooked chicken breast and almond cake.There is plenty of amount and taste!In addition to beer, you can choose other beverages.It is also recommended that Clara beer and lemon are mixed.If you go inside, the atmosphere of the store is better!\n",
      "We ate very well, the place is very beautiful and quite quiet.The attention of the waiters is also very good.At the price level there is everything, there are dishes that are quite forceful and well priced and others that for the amount that is perhaps is a bit high but in general we ate very well and we will surely return.\n",
      "Horrible. We have entered at 2:30 p.m. 8 people and at 4:00 p.m. they have taken out a salad that, not only was 1h and a half afternoon, but they left it on another table and we were the ones who had to retrieve the salad from the table of next to. Regrettable.\n",
      "Located in the heart of Barcelona. We came through a Smartbox and were quite pleased. The place is very spacious and even has a space for private events on the second floor. Good service and good atmosphere.\n",
      "We went two weeks ago and everything was great. The delicious food and the cozy place decorated with care.\n",
      "Very good experience in an excellent place. We went with a Smartbox reservation, and they already have the menu specially prepared.The staff, correct, without exceeding, and very good food, especially Catalan cream\n",
      "Good restaurant in the heart of the city. The treatment is correct and formal. They have a daily menu on weekdays at a very good price to be where you are. Quite complete. The food is just right and they have good dishes on the plate, as well as being rich. The atmosphere is formal, and the decoration is appropriate to the premises.\n",
      "Regular. There were a lot of people.\n",
      "It is very good, the lunch menu is super well priced. Also perfect for group lunches / dinners\n",
      "Very nice place to eat with family, the cuisine is rich and varied\n",
      "Correct pre, excellent service\n",
      "Excellent service and place\n",
      "I had come to this restaurant before and I was amazed by the menu and the atmosphere and I decided to take my family out to eat to get to know it. To my surprise, that of my family and several diners who shared a shift with us, has been a terrible experience.They have been overwhelmed throughout the day. Between courses almost 40 'of waiting.When the seconds after the long wait had been served, it seemed that they had run out of meat and had distributed the last secret steaks among the diners who ordered them. The portions between dishes being very uneven.They have given the dessert a name that had little to do with reality ... The pineapple with the aroma of star anise and cheese mousse, was a simple pineapple in syrup with Burgos cheese, and the ice cream with crumble was a sad ball ice cream on a broken Maria cookie.I don't know how they haven't been ashamed to serve him.People kept looking at the time and criticizing the delay.This complaint does not go to the waiters and cooks. It goes to the room manager for his mismanagement.He has not been able to approach any table and explain why this delay or apologize.My father has ordered an Irish coffee and without approaching the table he has told us that there was no left and has left without offering any change as an alternative.A real shame.\n",
      "A very good restaurant where you eat quite well a la carte, but it has a lunch menu that is very good at only ‚Ç¨ 12.50. (drink and dessert included). I recommend it. For the same cost a vulgar menu in any bar, here you eat well and with good service.\n",
      "Great restaurant, I really recommend, super fast service and the dishes are really delicious I loved it üòÑüëå\n",
      "A pleasant place to enjoy a good meal. The service is excellent.\n",
      "Good value for money.\n",
      "Good place to eat as a couple or with friends. The place is very nice and everything is very well cared for. The best are the restaurant's specialty dishes. The food in general is quite good although many dishes are quite average. It is the second time I go and this last time they forgot to bring us one of the dishes that they had brought because it was cold and they did not bring it back, but they apologized and brought us some glasses as compensation. Very good and happy the truth.\n",
      "Fantastic restaurant, very good food, very friendly staff\n",
      "An excellent dinner with a more than fair value for money\n",
      "We went as a family and the experience was unbeatable. Nice and professional treatment. Fast service. Excellent food at good prices, especially considering how central the restaurant is. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Beautiful, I went to an event but I wanted to go to eat with my partner.\n",
      "Despite belonging to a chain of restaurants the experience has been positive, a very interesting menu with the possibility of group menus. The place is nice although as it fills up it becomes very noisy\n",
      "Go to another house carmen that the boss here is a clown\n",
      "Excellent staff attention and dishes very well prepared and rich\n",
      "Large and beautiful place. Both Mediterranean and Japanese dishes. All very good although the gyozas were a bit dry. Being so wide they have tables for groups, but if you go to find tranquility you can find an outrageous atmosphere. Very good service, very attentive waiters.\n",
      "Perfect menu, very good menu with a good price. Perfect balance between quality and price\n",
      "Good service, daily menu with a variety to choose from and at a good price.\n",
      "Abnormal is the scam you have mounted. Small servings without flavor. A disgrace for Latin food as the quantity and taste speaks volumes. And this restaurant leaves much to be desired that if it survives it is by taking advantage of people who by not going to a Spaniard prefer to eat food from their land or simply someone else can try it and of course if you read it here it stops staining Latin food because someone foreigner gets an impression of what he is not. And this of course is not. I share a photo of what is five euros of beans. A bottle costs one euro does not arrive gentlemen and without flavor and does not reach half a glass to drink. Example of what this restaurant does. Id check it outI am a Dominican, I frequented a restaurant of all kinds, Colombian, Honduran, Venezuelan, and this is a substitute for everything.\n",
      "Very personally, I found myself completely lost with their menus and culinary proposals ... so much so that I ordered 3 formulas + 1 completely and ... arrived at the hotel impossible to know what was being eaten and with what ?!? More disappointment than pleasure for a prohibitive price: 75 ‚Ç¨ for 3 people to take away !! It's very salty!\n",
      "Two people went to eat, without a reservation, and they got us a table without problems. The nachos are some of the best I have ever eaten, although where they are served is not practical to eat them. The carnitas tacos were delicious. A bit frustrating is seeing that the local beer is San Miguel. The service is fast.\n",
      "I have loved it, excellent atmosphere, the place is very beautiful and the food is great, large portions. It was exactly how I saw it on Instagram.\n",
      "A great experience, you can eat all kinds of Latin American meals at once, including Mexican Tacos, salty and spicy Michelada beer, as well as tortillas Arepas from Colombia and Venezuela, Teque√±o cheese bars, cheese bars are very suitable When appetizers or small snacks are divided together, the fragrant cheese hearts are paired with hot freshly baked bread. We ate one and added another! We also ate Peruvian specialties: Ceviche, a marinated fish salad. The fish is very fresh, with sweet and sour sauce and super large corn kernels. It tastes very refreshing. The overall dishes are very good. The waiter is very kind. For dessert, the clerk I recommend cheesecake. It‚Äôs made by the store itself. It‚Äôs different from other cakes. It tastes like a mousse and is very moist. It just happened to have a friend‚Äôs birthday, and the clerk helped us light candles! The overall environment is clean and tidy, alcohol is provided on the table, the atmosphere is also very good, and the price is moderate. If you want to taste a variety of Latin American food at one time, the menu also offers Combo set options. I personally think it is very considerate and affordable and worth recommending!\n",
      "I went with two friends to eat and the three of us agreed that it was all delicious! The atmosphere was quiet and the tables are separated by screens, the service is very good, the menu is not excessively extensive and with well-made and tasty dishes, I also liked the beer menu, with several little-seen and good-tasting beers. We were in a hurry, so we have to go back and order dessert and a cocktail !!\n",
      "Very good quality price. Attention and incredible treatment by Angela, they take all the pertinent sanitary measures in an exemplary way.Highly recommended, we will return without a doubt.\n",
      "All great, I ordered some nachos and shredded meat tacos and it gives you an incredible explosion of flavor. The place is small but it is very well cared for and has a very Latin American atmosphere. The only complaint is that they charge you ‚Ç¨ 3 per drink.\n",
      "Great food, good service and charming place!We met him through the Joc de Cartes program on Tv3 that he won for being the best Mexican food restaurant and he does not disappoint!\n",
      "The little that I have been able to taste is incredibly good !!!! I loved it.First of all, some chicken empanadas that, wow, super good and original, with a sauce (they called it guasca if I'm not mistaken) that gives it a different and delicious touch. After the ceviche, my goodness what quality. I have really enjoyed it.I've been wanting to try more things.All this, taking into account that I have ordered through deliveroo and it has been incredible, makes me think that going to the restaurant must be a show! I am pointing it out to go soon!Also note that the home service is super careful, which is appreciated, with all kinds of sauces, and very well presented.What a great discovery today! Keep going!!!!\n",
      "Very good experience! The very cozy place, with screens to isolate between diners, hydroalcoholic gel on each table, Latin music that gives a lot of atmosphere, neither high nor low, you can talk to your table but it helps not to listen to the rest of the room. The food was very tasty, we chose nachos, teque√±os, wings, shredded meat tacos and two desserts. The presentation and flavor are 10, we loved it! üëèüèªüëèüèª\n",
      "We went with my wife at lunchtime, and the waiter Jhon served us in an excellent way, he recommended dishes, he was super attentive. The cozy, quiet place and also with security protocols that I have not seen in any other restaurant in Barcelona. In terms of flavor, presentation and texture it has been 10. A place that you have to return.\n",
      "Too much waiting.I went to eat with my family and when I arrived there were only two tables occupied.We placed our order and waited about an hour for the first dish to arrive.Yes, they only brought us one plate. We were 4 people, and we waited 30 or 40 more minutes for everything else to arrive.It's good. But it's not worth the wait.\n",
      "Very good place to eat and have a drink. The food is delicious, everything is homemade and it shows. The portions are correct and the price is very good for a Mexican restaurant (most are quite expensive) we asked several things to try and it was all very good. The treatment of the excellent staff, giving explanations at all times both at the security level (for covid issue) and explaining each dish that was brought to the table. I recommend booking or going early. Something that we really liked is that the water is filtered and once you ask for it, you can refill the bottle yourself as many times as you want. I recommend the wings, the nachos and the tacos and especially the cheescake with a touch of guava, really spectacular !! We will return for sure, we left delighted !!\n",
      "We tried the menu on Sant Jordi's day for ‚Ç¨ 36 with drinks. All very tasty. The great attention especially that of the French boy. They gave us a rose üåπ and some welcome straws. To put a but, as a suggestion of improvement, the dessert came inside the plastic container. I think that presented on a plate would be better. We will be back to try the ceviche that looked good.\n",
      "Super enchanted, an impeccable place Wonderful and very cozy, with a super treatment. 5 stars are too short for an assessment and Greg the waiter a super nice guy a super helpful person charm and not to mention the food the best place to delight in Mexican food without a doubt we will repeat as many times as possible‚Ä¶. We have been DELIGHTED and satisfied in every aspect and more when paying üò¶ Super cheap the best place in taste and price ... 100% recommended\n",
      "Honestly a bit disappointed, I think the Paisa tray doesn't deserve that name. How is it possible that I only bring a 2-3 cms cube of chicharron (bacon)? The quantities were super fair, the only thing that was in abundance was rice and beans. On the other hand, I asked for the \"teque√±oS\" which in the end turned out to be just one. I really wanted to try this restaurant but unfortunately I think I would not do it again, since for that price you can get an authentic Paisa tray.\n",
      "Delicious, we went to eat today and we loved it the best of all is the security measures are excellent as well as the service and theFood, we will return without a doubt\n",
      "Today we went to eat at the Anormal del Putxet and the experience has been very good.The reservation method through their website is very easy to follow, we also asked for a high chair and when we arrived everything was ready.The waiters who have attended us have been very friendly and attentive, they were aware at all times of how we were doing, if we were missing anything and if everything was to our liking. We had a small problem with the food (they gave us an ingredient that was not in one of the dishes) and by commenting on it to the waiter he solved it for us right away. We really liked the attention we received.The food was very good and the portions we consider to be ideal, not too little, not too much.The quality of the genre and the knowledge of the elaboration was remarkable.The price seemed good to us, it was around ‚Ç¨ 15 per person.In short, we really liked the restaurant, both in terms of food and service. The closeness and friendliness of the staff makes you feel really good in the establishment.Highly recommended. We will be back for sure.\n",
      "We went with a large group and we were able to be all inside. They have a couple of tables outside as well. The place is not very big but it is very well decorated, the music a little loud, but very good. Between tables there are screens to make the most of the space. The food is very good, we took a couple of combos, there are some that serve groups of 4 and you are quite good if you combine it with a starter. In the end for 15 euros you can have dinner and stay very well. Highly recommended !!\n",
      "Delicious food! But they have problems with flies / mosquitoes. Every time I went there (6 or 7 times), there were small flies around the table ... :(\n",
      "Investigating the gastronomic offer near the Lesseps square, we came across this Latin Street Food restaurant. Through their website it was easy to make a reservation to secure a table. Once there, reality exceeded expectations as the place was very pleasant and colorful, the music chosen according to the concept and the food was delicious. Very friendly staff advised us on amounts for two. We ordered half a portion of abnormal nachos, 2 teque√±os, 1 of cochinita tacos and one of patac√≥n. All exquisite and eager to repeat. The addictive teque√±os and the waters with delicious flavors. In addition to finishing off, a very tasty little coffee. From 10!\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "I had dinner with my husband last month 2 nights, and everything was wonderful. Food is ready fast, cold drink. And the portions are well served, congratulations!\n",
      "Excellent as always, today I went with a friend and they treated us very well. The nachos and suckling pig were delicious, before confinement I had gone to try the pataconada, the frozen margarita and a cheesecake. I will repeat soon. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Quality / price very good\n",
      "It is a Mexican and Colombian restaurant.A spectacular meal in the city of Barcelona.In Card Game (TV3 Program),winner in the best Mexican restaurant in Barcelona.\n",
      "The site, the menu and the dishes are simple and modern. A good place to surprise your friends with Mexican food. The staff is very attentive. In my opinion the entrees are too basic compared to the tacos and arepas which are very tasty.\n",
      "All very good, well prepared and presented. Good atmosphere and good service. The place is not very big and it is advisable to book on the weekend\n",
      "Nice place. Friendly staff. Varied and quality food. The drinks they make are very good and with curious tastes. They give you a complimentary glass of beer upon arrival.\n",
      "Magnificent. All highly recommended!\n",
      "Excellent cuisine, right portions. The food is very tasty and well presented. It cooks very original Colombian-Mexican fusion.\n",
      "everything is very good and the delivery service portions are well served\n",
      "Excellent place !!! Great food, excellent service and a very good quality / price ratio compared to other restaurants. Original and colorful decoration that give it a different touch. We will be back\n",
      "Very disappointing and unfortunate experience. Apparently it is more important to have a food menu with a \"cool\" aspect than really good food.If you like the posture more and that the food enters through the eyes in small portions, go ahead. If you really like to try quality food, there are many better places than this (it is not that complicated either)\n",
      "The food is good, quite good actually. But bad service. We had to cancel a second course because of the delay, the desserts were also canceled after 30 minutes of waiting and we had to ask for the bill 3 times. All this in a place with just 6 tables. I think the problem was the lack of staff, Between the Globo and deliverys, they did not give enough.\n",
      "It is ... another world, another way of understanding a restaurant specialized in South American cuisine (Colombian, Mexican and ceviche nuances).The cuisine is excellent, I advise asking about what is not clear so as not to err. They even dare with seasonal stews and soups.Good beers and desserts.Completely recommended in a group or couple.\n",
      "A spectacular place, with the best Latin cuisine, do not stop trying the nachos\n",
      "I tried some very rich nachos, it shows that they are super homemade, some cheese teque√±os were good ... then some cochinilla pil bil tacos ... it is very good value for money ... it is a place that when I have cravings for Latin food i will repeat\n",
      "Wao wao! How delicious and spicyee! Very good flavors !!! The place transferred me to my Latin lands! The music, the staff and the delicious food! The cheese of the teque√±os was good! The flavors of the nachos üëåüèº and the delicious meat!\n",
      "Very good food, nice local and impeccable service. We were served by a waiter with a French accent which made the experience even better. How wonderful to have this restaurant with the desire and taste to do things well! üëå\n",
      "The service is great, very attentive with very good vibes and very familiarGreat foodThe very cool placeThe music according to the site, we will repeat for sure, if it is not in this place it will be in the new one in Castelldefels or at home, since they serve at home. a 10 out of 10.\n",
      "As a restaurant it lacks, but to eat and taste it is good.\n",
      "Simply \"spectacular\" not only for the food that was excellent, but also for the treatment of John, our waiter. From the beginning he was attentive and patient. You rarely find such a service in Barcelona. Super recommendable\n",
      "A pleasant atmosphere and very good service. The food could be improved and the portions are a good measure. The great beers. The desserts disappointed us a little, but valuing in general, it is a good place to have dinner with friends.\n",
      "Very rich and fast.\n",
      "Very friendly staff! Good food and we have eaten for ‚Ç¨ 15 per person that in Barcelona is quite complicated\n",
      "Very pleasant and different place where you can try Latin food such as arepas, tacos ... Average value for money. We ordered a combo to try the essentials (fried combo), I was left wanting to try the tacos. They looked very good\n",
      "Excellent food, the best combination of Mexican and Colombian gastronomy. Besides that the place is very nice and transports you ...\n",
      "We placed an order through Deliveroo that never arrived, even so it was stated in the app that it had arrived. The delivery was made by the restaurant. Impossible to contact them by phone. A fraud.\n",
      "It's good! But that feeling of Latin flavor some things are missing. The waiters are a love, and everything is going pretty fast. I have seen that many people complain about the portions but I really think they are perfect.\n",
      "Good quality and excellent cocktails and Mexican food, one of the best in Barcelona.Located in the upper area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBarcelona ... totally recommended..salio. In a program of the best Mexican restaurant in Barcelona ..\n",
      "We just placed an order through Uber, we knew you but we had never asked or gone to the restaurant, and I should have said that it will take very little, we loved it !! A detail that arrives unassembled, you save yourself from receiving a wet or oily bag, more than enough quantities. Some incredible mecha meat tacos and the empanadas with that pico de gallo are from another world! If it's this good at home, I don't want to imagine myself in the restaurant. We'll go! Thanks!!\n",
      "The food is excellent and the place is very cozy with good music. In addition, the waiters are very friendly and advise very well. Highly recommended !!\n",
      "Today, my partner and I ate here and I would love to highlight the quality of everything: The food is really very good, we have enjoyed it very much. But I would like to highlight the impeccable and pleasant attention of the waitress. In addition, the sanitary measures are met above what is required, not only is there separation between tables, but each table has a separation screen and a bottle of disinfectant gel, both at the entrance of the restaurant and a bottle on each table.We will be back! Thank you for continuing to take care of and pamper your business despite the difficult times we are going through;)\n",
      "Spectacular attention.

Without a doubt I will repeat and when they can open I will visit the establishment.\n",
      "We ordered it through Glovo, we spent ‚Ç¨ 35 (a price for which you expect them to bring you acceptable tacos) and we received four bags full of cans of sauces and meat to make the tacos yourself, such was the accumulation of sauces that no You didn't even know what you were throwing yourself into, not to mention the concoction that is formed. I'm not saying it's unacceptable, but I don't think it's normal to send an order like this, especially because if you order it at home you don't want to start cooking later.

      "The food is delicious and they have a very varied menu. Very good value for money. They serve very fast. The waiters very attentive and friendly. I go there often. 100% recommended.\n",
      "Very good all you can eat sushi buffet and other Japanese dishes. The food is very good and the attention is also good, although as sushi is prepared at the moment if the place is full it can take a while. If you can, better order all the sushi at once.\n",
      "Quality price is one of the best in Barcelona to my liking. The product is good and fresh and they put a lot of fish in the portions. The restaurant is spotless and the service is fast, but there are waiters who don't know anything and sometimes the kitchen takes things out of you anyway.I recommend it, better to go soon because it fills up right away.Number 72 are battered prawns, you are going to become addicted !!\n",
      "Very good value for money, nice atmosphere, perfect to go with friends.\n",
      "Value for money, correct. Good attention.\n",
      "Very rich all and the attention is good !!\n",
      "Pretty much everything, great tablet ordering system, but the quality of the sushi has dropped quite a bit, too much rice ... I don‚Äôt recommend the tuna and duck.\n",
      "Great discovery! Today we have eaten very well, and we have been treated to 10!The buffet dinner cost us with water, ‚Ç¨ 18, ‚Ç¨ 85\n",
      "It's an all-you-can-eat menu but served at the table. We were well received and we were explained the concept (you choose from a numbered menu what you want to taste and write down your numbers on a piece of paper. The waiter brings your dishes little by little and when you have finished you repeat this step. that you want to eat).We mostly had sushi, gyozas, miso soup noodles. The sushi was very good! The waiter was attentive. Very good value for money with nice fresh produce for an all-you-can-eat buffet. Thanks to the whole team ! We ate well üôÇOnly point of improvement: The place in itself is not exceptional and deserves to be arranged and decorated to make it more welcoming and attractive. And offering desserts would also be great, such as sweet sushi, fruit salad, lychee, etc.\n",
      "Ask for the menu .... more of the same that you have tried in other Chinese restaurants. It would be good if both the letter and the paper menus had it. The presentation of the dishes has to be worked out more\n",
      "Very attentive staff. Small portions, you can try different things. Acceptable sushi for buffet, chicken with mushrooms and bamboo was not very good, but overall good value for money. We will repeat!\n",
      "It was the first time I went and I liked a lot. Good quality and good service. I will be back\n",
      "Amazing buffet\n",
      "Buffet restaurant with a lunch menu for less than 10 euros, quite rich.Sushi is pretty good\n",
      "The four of us buffe are very full. Most recommended is pato lemon chicken (pollo limon). Like it üëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n",
      "Along with Chun is one of the best Japanese buffet places, cheap price, delicious food and very friendly attention. I recommend it\n",
      "Very good everything, 10/10 <3\n",
      "Cozy restaurant (less than 15 tables). Fast service. Quality quite good, apart from the menu of dishes, there is another list to part where they offer other dishes out of the letter (such as News). The presentation of the dish is simple but abundant. They have air conditioning. I recommend it.\n",
      "Free buffet menu with water for ‚Ç¨ 18.50. The food very good, a lot of variety of dishes but in the end everything very similar. The service very friendly but a little slow.\n",
      "The local lacks a lot to improve. Dark and nothing to do with a restaurant. The food pretty good. Good service, they recommend you and everything.Buffet price within normal. No surprisesThe best the spicy veal, I loved it!\n",
      "Recommended restaurant! Good value for moneyThe only downside I would put is that the place is small for me, since when we went it was full, I think that if it were bigger they would also have people!We went in August, on vacation because of recommendations that we saw on YouTube, the truth is that we were not disappointed, the waiter was very nice and the food was very tasty üòã\n",
      "Japanese and Chinese buffet restaurants since it has a combination of Chinese and Japanese dishes on the other hand you can only give 3 stars why the frying is not its strong the very oily prawns the dumplings nothing from the other world, the ramen I did not like, the Good sushi is not a big deal and the dessert was really frozen and tasteless. But on the other hand, dessert or coffee enters the menu, I have eaten the best and you no longer get the drink but they already charge you well to raise the price.\n",
      "It eats very well !!!\n",
      "Good quality of rice. A very appetizing texture. If it is sushi, but not in any way, but with quality and good presentation. Good price / quality.The place is simple and does not offer a busy atmosphere. It is comfortable and cozy.The service is close.\n",
      "Very good, with restrictions and all. Good food and very good yaky teri (I don't know how to spell it). Very correct waiters.\n",
      "The shushi is not tasty. The other dishes such as gyozas, Vietnamese rolls etc if we liked it. You fill up and that's it. The dessert I ordered Tiramisu and I didn't eat it ... You fill up for what you pay.\n",
      "The food is very good, it has a lot of variety and they serve very quickly. The dessert enters the free buffet, something very rare and that gives it many points. The place has a nice atmosphere although it is a little small, you can see how they make sushi as soon as you enter the door. The seats are comfortable and the tables are a normal size. On the other hand, the waiters are very rude and unpleasant, the waitress is heaven, very attentive and respectful. I highly recommend the butterfish sushi and sashimi, the gyozas, the yakisoba, and the green tea ice cream. I do not recommend the corn chowder.\n",
      "Not bad. But the right rations.\n",
      "The best Japanese buffet that I have ever been to\n",
      "Halfway between Chinese and Japanese. Facilities that can be improved. It is difficult for you to order and you have to look for the waiters. Excellent and varied food.\n",
      "Very well\n",
      "My favorite Japanese buffet\n",
      "The truth is that due to the area where it is located and the opinions they had given me, I expected much more from this place. Little variety of sushi, the rice melted into nothing and the pieces of fish were not very generous compared to other restaurants of this style.\n",
      "Good service, ideal value for money. Totally recommendable\n",
      "Good service, good value for money. Good variety of dishes.\n",
      "The quality has dropped quite a bit lately, but it's still pretty good.Everything you want to eat and at a fixed price.\n",
      "It is the third time that I have come free buffet with a letter ....\n",
      "Good service and food for the price. But the place is very small and a lot of noise is generated.\n",
      "It eats very well. Whether you make menu or buffet. For the buffet, you can choose the dishes with the menu and they bring it to the table. You can order whatever you want.\n",
      "Not bad\n",
      "Spectacular treatment, spectacular flavor ... the best in terms of value for money, the sushi rice melts in your mouth.\n",
      "The service attitude is quite good, and the taste of the food is above average. The serving is fast. The decoration is simple and generous. quiet place.\n",
      "My favorite Japanese restaurant. I've known him since they opened. Excellent quality and service\n",
      "As always and always the best sushi and Japanese food in the city, we will certainly repeat soon! Thanks!!\n",
      "Everything is correct\n",
      "The best of bcn\n",
      "Japanese restaurant. The lighting and decoration could be improved. Good computer system for ordering. The variety of dishes is correct but I would add some sushy dishes. In general all the pieces are very good. The price is ‚Ç¨ 21-23 / pax on weekends\n",
      "Simple restaurant with good cuisine\n",
      "Excellent quality, price and service\n",
      "I really like this place. For my relationship quality price is ideal! Maybe it's not the best Japanese barcelona but the food and good service is worth it. I am a regular customer for at least 3 years and do not disappoint.\n",
      "We will repeat 100%\n",
      "Good value, nice place, simple and clean. The staff is very attentive and friendly.The only one is that they serve the hot drink.\n",
      "While you eat it, it happens, but I have been three times and all three I have regretted being ill the next day. All full of glutamate\n",
      "We organized a company dinner at this place, although the quality was good, everything we asked for did not serve us even half, we did another second round and the same, of all the variety we ordered only uploaded what They were interested. Slow service, I would never recommend it for large groups\n",
      "The food is OK but there are better places, the staff are attentive and fast\n",
      "Excellent and quality Japanese. Very amble staff üëç\n",
      "Very good quality prices and good service\n",
      "A lot of noise, the treatment is good but as it is a zulo type, with more than 3 tables it is unbearable. There is a big echo. The food, one of the weakest Japanese I've ever been to. Rice too hard. And the edamame, they had an aniseed flavor that I don't particularly like. 30 euroz two people with the daily menu and drinks. Not bad. The soup miso ed water with a 1 cm piece of soy. I really didn't like it. And if it comes together that now with the covid they make you look at the letter on the internet and being zulo, there is no coverage, you are 3 hours to ask ... finally\n",
      "Good cuisine and good menu. Varied menu to choose from, fixed price\n",
      "Quality great price. They bring you fast food, fresh ingredients and cooked on the spot. My partner and I have been there repeatedly and we never get tired. It is best to go from Monday to Friday at noon since the menu is cheaper, and the variation of dishes between the normal menu and the special is 3 or 4 dishes at most, you really don't miss anything asking for the special. All the dishes are very good, the service is very good, and I recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "Hu Nan, my heart's restaurantValuing your food is a challengeI don't know how to express my opinionSo I decided to make a sonnetThe service was always excellentWell, I have no complaints about the staffI am aware of the variety of the menuBetter to go as a group than as a coupleYakisoba, sushi, dishes with colorAlthough in my opinion it is not cheap,It compensates the quantity and its good flavorI hope my story serves youPutting 3 stars fills me with bitternessIt is ideal for having a good time\n",
      "Good value for money.\n",
      "Value for money very good. Attentive and friendly service. An aspect to highlight are the fritters, very light and achieved, not as in other sites of similar characteristics. We will repeat !!!\n",
      "Much noise in the dining room.Average food at a good price.\n",
      "For group reservations I DO NOT recommend it, they serve the food in the balal√°, just like drinks. We made dinner there about 30 people and a little chaos. We were promised the 1st floor just for us with karaoke and nothing at all. They also pressed us to remove a table and thus raise other customers. The food is good, one thing does not take away the other of course. I may go again because I imagine giving dinner to a group is complicated.\n",
      "this place has a free buffet for my taste very complete, very good tasting sushi, comfortable and cozy place, friendly and attentive workers, good treatment, recommended place.\n",
      "Food is ok I do not know because the gyozas are repeated a lot .. maybe they put more onion than usual or with those we went we were silly of the belly ..Overall good!\n",
      "They have a lot of customers for the offer they promote, in the end although the attention is not bad, they can not with so much, they take a lot and it becomes a bit messy, the food did not feel so spectacular (it may be for the wait) , and good for this I prefer to go to other places where I can feel tranquility and a fluidity with the time of reception of the dishes and would spend the same.It's not a bad place, they do what they can, but it's not the best either.\n",
      "Let's see, for what one pays is fine but nevertheless the service is very slow. Many times you order dishes and they bring what they want. The gyozas are quite good, the rices are also good. The potato omelette is not the best and the gazpacho has to be improved. What they call \"Japanese croquettes\" is an attempt at croquettes but poorly made. Desserts are decent. Carrot ice cream had never tasted it but it was good, and from what my companions said the pistachio cake was good too.\n",
      "It's the typical Chinese / Japanese you keep asking for until you're fed up. For the quality of the food the price is right (you can't ask for more).The place is small and could be a little cleaner. Ideal for eating a quick lunch menu and pausing from work.\n",
      "very good taste, fast service and friendly workers.\n",
      "Everything is super good! You have to go. The waiters are super friendly and if you have any questions you explain everything. Also, if you have younger children, you can ask them to put you like a plastic that holds both sticks and you don't have to do all that maneuvering to grab the sushi. üòäüåç\n",
      "It's not about throwing rockets but it's fine\n",
      "Fast serviceid i amable Good food. The uninvolved space\n",
      "Quality very correct price. The spectacular teriyaki chicken !!! I've been a couple of times already, and great.\n",
      "a very good sushi\n",
      "It is a very good restaurant, totally recommendable. I love it. The only negative point is that they don't take care of you in Catalan, but other than that the rest is perfect.\n",
      "Very good food and very efficient. Ideal if you like Asian food.\n",
      "Correct service-quality-price ... fast and unpretentious ... very digestive and maybe missing a sake to finish ...\n",
      "Good food but little supply, service and decoration quite improveable and expensive menu for what it offers.\n",
      "Excellent food with a good price. Being unlimited food with its free buffet menu, its quantities are very correct and the service is fast and efficient. No reproach\n",
      "It is a Japanese-Japanese with an economical menu to go on weekdays. ‚Ç¨ 9.90 you can not ask for more!\n",
      "Good atmosphere and go down the price level\n",
      "Sushi is good but they have little supply, they are too simple, at most 2 or 3 ingredients. Although the starters are very good\n",
      "Good atmosphere, very fresh food good attention.\n",
      "Spectacular free buffet. Variety and quality more than correct in relation to price.Tables a little fair and small when ordering, as with 2 or 3 plates they are full.Interesting for small groups.\n",
      "Recommended buffet.Fast, attentive service.No frills, restaurant to eat well (tasty food), fast (ideal for business and schools / academies) and cheap for the area where it is located (buffet ‚Ç¨ 13, dessert included)\n",
      "Good space and nice. It does not bother the noise. The food was pretty good, we liked it\n",
      "As a pseudo-Japanese restaurant it's fine. Very good quality / price ratio. In fact it fills up very fast. Menu with many dishes to choose from in the special buffet menu where you order all the dishes you want from the menu. Totally recommended always knowing that it is not an authentic japo.\n",
      "Menu of nights and holidays. Nice treatment and fast and attentive service.\n",
      "Good quality food and good service\n",
      "Free buffet of good quality for an affordable price.A lot of dishes.The fish is usually very good.The only complaint is that if you ask for more than one serving, they usually bring you the amount that looks good to you, which does not have to be the one you asked for.\n",
      "It's a sushi buffet restaurant. The service is not too good and neither is the variety. I think there are many other options in Barcelona before going to this restaurant.\n",
      "Good quality price.\n",
      "Japanese food with good value. Free buffet for ‚Ç¨ 11 (dessert or coffee included). The only negative part is the dessert, that there is nothing \"homemade\".\n",
      "Great place, a la carte buffet good portions\n",
      "Great Free buffet of good quality and good service. Better than many.\n",
      "Free menu for about ‚Ç¨ 20 with drink. Good choice. Of the free card one of the best.\n",
      "I love food and service and Mr. Hu Nan is a good professional\n",
      "Very basic sushi restaurant, very good price but if you want to try variety this is not the place. You can eat as much as you like, noisy local.\n",
      "Good quality but there could be a little more variety on the menu\n",
      "Very very good food\n",
      "Perfect! Good price. You do not finish what you pay\n",
      "Japanese with free √† la carte buffet, very good food, very correct sushi!\n",
      "Concept of free buffet √† la carte with different prices, the lowest limits a limit of dishes to choose that is enough for lunch. The days with more time and hunger for a couple of euros more you have the letter at full disposal and to ask until you are satisfied. The food is good. The worst, the noise, when full noise pollution is unbearable.\n",
      "It is very good, the product is fresh and the portions are perfect, I never tire of going.\n",
      "We have eaten great. You can order a menu, or the Buffet option with 2 different prices, you write down on a sheet what you want and they bring it to your table. Drink not included. The right service and place.\n",
      "Very good food, excellent service from the waitress, good recommendations on what to order\n",
      "Good value for money and lots of variety.\n",
      "Very good Asian \\ Japanese restaurant for quality and price. We have been customers for many years and it has always seemed good to us. And now more for their new letter of flamb√©ed nigiril\n",
      "The food is exquisite and especially the daily menu that is ‚Ç¨ 16.50 that you have all the Temakis makis and others you want. Above all quality\n",
      "I loved everything about this restaurant the service was very fast, very friendly and the food was excellent I liked it all there was nothing that I did not like I ate until it almost exploded it was almost missing just for the waiter to eat me!I'm sure I'll be back very soon!\n",
      "Free working lunch buffet 11.50 euros. Acceptable quality.\n",
      "I can say that the fish is fresh and with good flavor, they put too much rice in the sushi portions and it is not well cooked. The nori seaweed has been inedible, elastic and hard. In the menu there is a lot of variety but mixing Chinese, Asian and Thai food. The desserts are frozen cakes, not even a simple green tea ice cream.\n",
      "The best place to eat a free buffet at midday and midweek, a fast and attentive service, good variety of sushi and high quality, apart from many Asian dishes. At midday ‚Ç¨ 11.50 without drink included, good price.\n",
      "Quality price very very good\n",
      "Varied Japanese buffet with very good food and good value for money. Fast and acceptable service.Desserts included in the menu quite poor\n",
      "Good all-you-can-eat buffet! It eats very well for what it is and the employees are very friendly.\n",
      "Restaurant well located in the Francesc Maci√† area. The site is spacious and fresh. The standard free buffet, the starters a bit loose and the sushi ok. Maybe someone else was missing attending. Right price with dessert included.\n",
      "Good place, and good food\n",
      "Good variety of sushi and companions. Very correct price for the quality that is offered. Fairly quick to serve. Coffee good enough to be the typical Japanese buffet. I recommend it.\n",
      "The deal, without a doubt the worst of my life. They had never been so rude to me in a restaurant.I speak for an older Asian woman who catered to customers screaming, in bad manners, almost throwing dishes on the table, rushing to ask and \"scolding\" customers for not asking fast. When you've been a while and you keep asking for the forms, they get much worse and it shows that they want you to leave.A shame I will not go back EVER, I went with a group of friends trying to look good and it was a very uncomfortable situation.We ended up asking him if he could please speak well and not be so rude, my worst experience in a restaurant.The quality of the fish is good, but it is not worth it because of how uncomfortable it is to eat.\n",
      "Good food, good service and reasonable price. I will certainly repeat.\n",
      "Excellent, delicious Tapas and fine service.Been there five years ago, now been back.Again in 5 years!!!\n",
      "The food and the price of 10. The service - 10. We have ordered 10 skewers, some patatas Bravas and some rejos. The waitress brought us the food half an hour after ordering it and without the drink. Slow, careless, forgetful and clumsy. Of the bars and the Bravas no trace. When asked, he tells us that he has forgotten. A real shame that this restaurant has such bad service. When they solve it there will be no problems.\n",
      "Great experience .. near the Sagrada Familia, good selection of cold tapas. The paella mixed with meat and shellfish is exceptional. Fair price.\n",
      "The food was bomb ...... thePaellia was really good and so were the tapas.Service very friendly and the price is right.If we come back to Barcelona we will definitely eat there again.\n",
      "Very tasty, especially the cold tapas platter was awesome!\n",
      "Normal prices, abundant quantities, it is a pity that the paella rice was overcooked and therefore heavy and that the dish itself had no taste, if not that of lemon. There are places where you can eat better paella. Not recommended\n",
      "It was completely unexpected to find in the tourist quarter both excellent service and very tasty food. It seems that this restaurant is a family one, where it is very important for everyone that every visitor is satisfied. We ordered a small burger for the child, expected a small hamburger. But it turned out that these are 4 small cutlets + village potatoes, very tasty. We took a set of tapas to choose from, the set includes 8 pieces. At first, they could not understand the principle of how to choose them and how to control them. It turned out that you take it yourself, as many times as you want and what you want. Here, these are such small sandwiches with all possible ingredients - salmon, hummus, sausage, tuna, nuts, anchovies, chorizo, jamon and much more. Sticks are inserted into each sandwich, at the end they are counted, and, 8, this is 1 serving, then up to 16 - 2, and so on. We also ordered sangria and again a surprise. Here, however, he was controversial, the wine was tart, rich and not spoiled as usual. It was super. What is not quite super - a lot of sugar, it is difficult to drink, not for everybody. Not at all like most light, effervescent and fruity sangria as used to. It was a pity that we had to leave, we were in a hurry for the train, I wanted to try many other dishes that were brought to our neighbors - luxurious paella, which we had eaten so many times, but here it seemed like a super masterpiece, Andalusian squid, fish croquettes, etc. We recommend and want to eat there again.P.S. The decor is very simple, without pathos, and that's great.\n",
      "Fatal, the new owners are French. The bread was hard and soaked. Hot skewers, now it's time to order them. We will not be going back\n",
      "The tapas should be at 1 euro, you don't realize it and your money is wasted\n",
      "Very good pinchos next to the Sagrada Familia\n",
      "I didn't expect to have such an approachable restaurant next to such a hot tourist area. I personally think that the food is delicious and not expensive, pincho 1.6‚Ç¨/pc, paella 13.35‚Ç¨ (small serving), although the decoration is really not very beautiful, but I highly recommend everyone to tasteLos pinchos y paella son muy ricos. Lo que m√°s importante son los precios buenos aunque est√° muy cerca de La Sagrada Familia.\n",
      "Excellent. A great quality of their products like Pinchos, Tapas, Raciones, A large dining room with very good air conditioning and excellent service by their employees both in bars and tables. A good terrace outside the bar. Excellent attention from the camara @ s Laia, Aran and Quique. And especially the kitchen staff for their rich products. I will go publishing photos ..... if I allow it clear ...\n",
      "We went for drinks and we were very comfortable. The glasses were good but it took a while to bring them\n",
      "Perfect we have a good evening.\n",
      "Good place to eat typical dishes of Barcelona. The tapas that were served were very rich and the paella was homemade, with a delicious flavor and plenty of portions. The place very nice, fresh with a decoration that looks good. The excellent service and the acceptable prices for the area in which it is. I highly recommend this place and above all, the paella.\n",
      "The service is impeccable, the managers are adorable, very nice and good advice! The food is very decent for the price (17th all-you-can-eat menu)I recommend this address for those who want to taste as much tapas as possible !!Thank you again for this pleasant moment!\n",
      "Very good discovery.Warm and welcoming staff.The tapas menus at the top.Value for money by appointment.Super fresh products.I highly recommend\n",
      "Good pintxos at a good price in a cozy place. Good treatment and good service.\n",
      "The price of Pinchos is 1.6 ‚Ç¨. It was 0.1 ‚Ç¨ more than before, but the price has increased. There are other menus, but I think the fun here is Pinchos.All restaurants around the Sagrada Familia are expensive, so it's cheap and easy. The taste is suitable for the price.Since it is open from noon to midnight, depending on the timing, the warmer will turn in order from the back seat, and the rest will be in the counter glass case. So quality and freshness depend on the time you go.All waiters feel good.\n",
      "A place to have good pinchos for ‚Ç¨ 1.50 each.Very friendly treatment and everything at the perfect pace.Very good cabrales cheese potatoes.\n",
      "In my opinion, one of the best places to eat some pinchos and have a beer. ‚Ç¨ 1.70 for both hot and cold skewers.I have had the opportunity to eat there as well and I must highly recommend it.In the end they gave me a strawberry with chocolate, the detail is appreciated.\n",
      "It is a restaurant near Sagrada Familia exit.I've got 8 pieces of cold tapas and a paella mixed with seafood and meat. Although the tapas bread was hard, the topping was delicious. The paella was a bit salty, but the squid and meat were so thin that it was delicious!\n",
      "We were delighted with this establishment. The pinchos are very varied. There is something for every taste. They are of good quality and very fresh. In addition, the place is magical at the foot of the Sagrada Familia. What about the service, perfect and more, very attentive and with little care for its customers. I highly recommend to have a good time.\n",
      "Just amazingly surprised to have found this great place at the foot of the Sagrada Familia! The waitress is of a kindness to any test super amiable who speaks a little French and you will understand very very well in English too! We feasted with these great tapas ... you would judge yourself by these photos ... installed you benefited\n",
      "Vegan Restaurant. I recommend.\n",
      "A toothpick 1.5 Euro sangria 6.15 A cup of bread is crispy The best thing to eat is fried. The ingredients are very sweet! The waiter is very nice, but a little busy.\n",
      "Perfect ! thank you for your welcome\n",
      "The tapas are very good, especially the hot ones. Very friendly waitress.\n",
      "very good restaurant perfect welcome, delicious food by far one of the best establishments\n",
      "Excellent attention üëå the tapas are very good and they have good wine üç∑\n",
      "Informal restaurant with excellent location friendly waiters and menus in Italian located near the sagrada family highly recommended the paella and the tapas which are self service only downside the price a little high. Pay attention to the waiter who passes with tapas but they are not free and are paid, but unlike the self service tapas those of the waiter are hot.\n",
      "Tapas very rich !!\n",
      "Good welcome, good place facing the sagrada familia and very good food for cheap\n",
      "Okay, but they have changed owners, before I liked it better, next time to see if it improves\n",
      "Very good food and attention\n",
      "Excellent tapas bar located around the corner from La Sagrada Familia street. Great place to grab a bite to eat before visiting the cathedral. There is an all-you-can-eat menu for around 15-16 euros. Several wines available at reasonable prices. There are a variety of bites on slices of bread: sausages, cheeses, anchovies, apple jelly, tuna, tomatoes, artichokes, etc. There is plenty of room inside and a few tables outside.\n",
      "Very tasty Argentine food, although the special Argentine barbecue has outgrown me, perhaps because there were four of us. The potatoes were delicious and the empanadas too, in general all delicious and the attention was correct.What I don't understand is because the dessert menu has no prices.\n",

      "They charge 1 euro to bring the food that we have paid for and have not finished consuming, I ask for a bag and they do not have it. Above we say that it is a pity that the beauty of the site is lost for that euro and the owner or manager answers that it is a pity that I make the comment on the euro.He tells me that in the supermarket they charge me 10 cents for a bag, to which we answer that in the supermarket we are not going to eat. We have spent ‚Ç¨ 96 not 20.The quality of service does not exist\n",

We will be back.\n",
      "At first we wanted to sit on the terrace, but in the end, as there were quite a few people, we decided to have dinner inside. Quiet restaurant. Very good and abundant tapas as seen in the photos at a good price. The staff was friendly.\n",
      "Really very good food. Good value for money. Waiters a bit their own way; We finished dessert and no one spoke to us until 1 hour later. But the place is really very nice and cozy and you dine very well.The ones in the photos are the Russian salad and the croquettes (very tasty) and the cheese cake (one of the best I've ever had).\n",
      "Pleasant and discreet place, where all its staff make you feel at home.The food is exquisite and served with love. Even the take-out is flawlessly presented.\n",
      "It is a very prestigious restaurant, therefore the prices are high. The products are of very good quality and it shows that the staff is qualified.As aspects to improve, the tables in front of the kitchen cannot enjoy tranquility and the portions are somewhat insufficient.Recommended the tiramisu for dessert, that is a good dish!\n",
      "Higher expectations than I thought. Some exhausted letter dessert. Fair quantities for the price. More image than quality\n",
      "The truth is that the restaurant was immaculate. Both the terrace and the interior are very beautiful and original. Friendly service and good food.I recommend it.\n",
      "Spectacular place, the food of another level especially the cuttlefish croquettes and the melanzane buaffff makes my mouth water just thinking about it !!!The attention was the best, we were a group of friends with couples and we had a great time, the spectacular cava sangria, and each item served in its own time respecting the spaces and letting us taste everything !!We will definitely be back\n",

      "Brutal üî•üî•üî• spectacular place, 10 service and movie theater food. Half of the menu is Mediterranean food and the other half Italian. Special mention to the Parmigiana, the tomato salad with avocado and belly, the Tuna Tataki with a salmorejo base, and for dessert the banana ice cream with biscuit! üòã\n",
      "Very well maintained restaurant with a very well selected menu. Quality product.\n",
      "The best restaurant I have tried in relation to quality / price. All the delicious dishes, the unbeatable attention, very fast, very polite and friendly at all times.

      "Excellent treatment and very good experience. The starters are excellent, I recommend the salmon tartare and the burratina.Second, the black squid risotto and spaghetti carbonara are excellent.Quality / price very good, a dinner for ‚Ç¨ 25 / person with two starters and a main course (we did not have dessert). Without a doubt, letting you be advised by the wine is the great added value.Definitely 5/5.\n",

      "A pleasant, bright place with charm. Open kitchen. Very rich food, Catalan and Italian menu. Kind and effective attention.\n",
      "A fantastic meal !!An elegant, contemporary restaurant with a very good atmosphere.The waiters welcome you with a smile and accompany you to the table with great sympathy and professionalism. Just sitting down they bring you some sticks and bread that already cheer you up, I have always liked them, while you read the Letter. I accompanied them by ordering the Parmesan cheese tapa that is accompanied with a sauce of balsamic vinegar of Modena. I, of course, dressed them and it was, I recommend it.The menu is very extensive: the Barcelona menu with tapas, typical dishes such as broken eggs, escudella ... Although I chose Italian dishes from Milan. It has sorprised me for good!The burrata with confit tomato is delicious and generous in measure. A dish to share that will not leave you indifferent.Second, I ordered some lobster spaghetti that were not on the menu, but I do not regret ordering. Delicious Although it raised the average price of food, they are so rich that you forget.If you order √† la carte, the average price is 15 euros for a second course, so value for money is more than correct. The lobster came out at 40, but it is lobster.For dessert and to top it off I ordered the classic Tiramisu but the restaurant presents it in the form of an original long meringue. Be careful, share it if you don't want to go out in a balloon. A real pleasure bomb !!!. The coffee-flavored mascapne left me the best of flavors.I will repeat. Covid respects you all hours üëç\n",

      "Good service and very good food\n",
      "A very cozy restaurant, which makes you feel at home from the moment you enter.We have gone several times with the family and we have not been disappointed in any of them, the portions are just enough to order a starter first and second plus dessert.Even and the amount that may seem of dishes, the price does not skyrocketIf you have the opportunity to take advantage of it, it is 100% recommended\n",
      "I always repeat, good quality and with a lot of variety of dishes. Of course, great restaurant and they go for work. You will always look good but it is not a charming restaurant.\n",

      "The best value for money, the attention is incomparable, grateful for the attention of Antonio, Pe√±a and others.!\n",
      "Italian-Catalan restaurant. The main dishes, rather Italian, the starters rather Catalan.Normal price for quality level, which is good enough. The pasta, good. Meats, too.Very modern atmosphere, a bit quirky clientele.\n",
      "A place with a quality of 10, an attention of 10, very large, spacious, beautiful space, all very clean with an open kitchen. A delicious meal with a very wide menu for all palates, for me a spectacular place.\n",

      "The tiramisu is spectacular! I really recommend everything\n",
      "The atmosphere, the service and the care that they make of the homemade product is excellent, without a doubt one of the restaurants in Barcelona that you should go to. Highlight the great selection of wines they have, the strawberry millefeuille and the ice creams made in the restaurant.\n",
      "Delicious as always. It never fails.\n",
      "We were a group of 10 and ate very well. Dishes with a lot of craftsmanship and quality products.For me the very good crispy pork ear, the base of pumpkin, onion and bittersweet sauce, very well found.Very good croquettes.Very good place for lunch or dinner.Very correct service.\n",
      "Restaurant located in Gr√†cia where they offer a tapas menu and two menus. This time we decided on the menu where they offer dishes to share for ‚Ç¨ 31.All very good and well presented. For ‚Ç¨ 31 it would include the drink, at least a glass of wine or soda. Quite tiny dishes especially dessert. We will repeat when they let us go at night and test if they deserve the 5 stars.\n",
      "Terrific. High level of cuisine, although you pay for it in portions that could be a tad more generous. Still, the croquettes and their grilled squid with tomato and watermelon are so good that they clearly deserve the highest score. The dish that I would not recommend is the bacon with prawns ... too greasy for my taste. The rest, a luxury.\n",
      "The site is very good .. very local ..\n",
      "Expensive menu but very good value for money. Highly recommended. Excellent service.\n",
      "Amazing food. Excellent service. 100% recommendable\n",
      "Super good food, especially for their ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù dishes, meaning you don‚Äôt find these ingredient combinations everywhere. The customer service is very good and the price a bit expensive but it's all so good you don't even notice.\n",
      "A find after visiting Park G√ºell. The proposals of this young group do not leave you indifferent. Be careful asking for a table in advance, we almost ran out of it.\n",
      "COOL!! Menu with many varied dishes, rich and well presented, agility when serving and a very pleasant and quiet terrace. FANTASTIC, although not inexpensive.\n",
      "Traditional Catalan tapas with Japanese touches and careful preparation. Highly recommended\n",
      "Restaurant located in the Gracia neighborhood.We have gone as a couple and we have ordered all varied and spectacular tapas.The anchovies were delicious, the cockles brutal, I think they are one of the best cockles I have ever tasted, very large and tasty.The foie terrine is highly recommended, although if it came with a few toasts, better.Grilled aubergine with cheese and sesame cream and very correct croquettes and the octopus a tad dry but very rich in combination and texture.The beer is very good although the price is exaggerated (even if it's artisan, ‚Ç¨ 4.20 ...) although they make up for it because they bring you 1.5L of water for free.The service is very nice and efficient despite the restaurant being packed.We will repeat for sure!\n",
      "Very good and elaborate food. Service is another matter, the attention is good, but it looks more like a menu bar, it lacks a touch of excellence when serving.\n",
      "Very good! We went to dinner and ordered, among other things, croquettes, poached egg and yarrow. Very good quality and taste. The space is large and beautifully decorated. The white wine we ordered: perfect! In total we paid ‚Ç¨ 21 per head. Although we had booked and arrived 20min late, they looked after us and were very friendly and professional. Highly recommended!\n",
      "As good as expensive. If you want to be full you will pay a lot, but it is argued with how good everything is. The quality is paid and the place in Gr√†cia too. Very nice terrace and very correct service.\n",
      "Very good but sweet. The very alternative place.\n",
      "Mediterranean food with innovative offer. I went to dinner with some friends and we ordered several dishes to share and a dessert. All very good. I recommend the cuttlefish rice.In our case, the only problem is that we pay more for the drink than for the food. The glasses of wine range between ‚Ç¨ 4 and ‚Ç¨ 4'70. If I ever come back I will ask for a bottle for sure, or I will take a better look at the prices üòÇCorrect service.\n",
      "All very good and courteous staff! A must go if you are returning from park Guell\n",
      "I really loved very good tapas and very nice service. Craft beer. Reservations required\n",
      "La Panxa del Bisbe has been a discovery in the district of Gr√†cia. It has a very nice inner courtyard, which is even more valuable in summer and in times of pandemic.It‚Äôs a bit expensive, but it fits the quality of the food it offers: original and tasty dishes ideal for sharing, such as foie with caviar lentils; quesadillas with provolone; grilled squid, or a refreshing and amazing mojito-flavored melon dessert.In short, a quiet space with friendly and professional service. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Excellent gourmet cuisine, a warm atmosphere, a very friendly service ... to reserve!\n",
      "Very elaborate delicatessen dishes, all very tasty, perhaps a little expensive for the quantity but it has been worth the experience.\n",
      "Food cannot be judged. The service effectively discouraged me from staying in the premises. First she didn't take care of us, and then she unpleasantly exaggerated us twice. We felt uninvited so we left. We do not greet the rude waitress.\n",
      "A spectacular place! We made the snack menu (30 ‚Ç¨ / person) and we loved it !!! The place is beautiful, the service very fast and very attentive and the food great! We recommend it!\n",

      "Highly recommended! Good product and friendly service. We will repeat\n",
      "Casual restaurant with signature cuisine. All great. Very attentive and friendly service. They only have craft beers. Water is free. The dog? The quantity-price ... very small portions for the price they have.\n",
      "Too many dishes. All very good, but not so much food. Dessert, bundle of toast with oil and chocolate ... Brutal.\n",
      "Original and very good quality restaurant.La Panxa del Bisbe is an atypical place in the neighborhood of Gracia.The cuisine is sophisticated but tasty and you can enjoy the experience of having a tasting menu of the most \"apa√±ao\".Make no mistake about it ... it is not a Michelin star restaurant but it is the best value for money.We took the \"variadillu menu\" and were able to try a great variety of dishes served there.I recommend it if it is the first time you are going to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat type of cuisine they do.You don't stay hungry with the menu.The service is more than correct and they have a varied wine list.The shooter beer is artisan but, to my liking, some toasted or dark beer was missing.The main course is the great dessert of \"Pa amb xocolata oli i sal\" an explosion of flavors on the palate, bitter, salty, sweet ... impressive. I leave you a shabby photo of it.All the food is prepared with quality ingredients and it shows.Nothing was repeated to us despite taking a great mix of dishes and ingredients.The place is small and with a discreet but cozy decoration.We didn't go to the toilets so I can't tell you how they were.They have an interior terrace where I think you can smoke.The kitchen is open with a large bar and depending on where you sit you can see the bustle of the cooks preparing the dishes.In short, a good place to pay homage or surprise a friend or visit with a varied and original menu.\n",
      "Tot mooolt bo. Original dishes, very tasty and with the right amount. Good wines from little-known wineries. Very good customer service.\n",
      "Cozy place and beautiful industrial style, seasonal product with very rich tapas. Reasonable value for money, important to book as it is always full. Good service i advise you. They have craft beers and the water is free. Price for 2 people: 4 dishes + bread with tomato + 2 craft beers and 1 dessert to share ‚Ç¨ 59.10 üëåwe will be back another day.\n",
      "Spectacular. Very good food and excellent service. To repeat several times.\n",
      "If you doubt one of the best restaurants in Barcelona. And if you consider it from the point of view of value for money, it is definitely the best. You can eat from classic Catalan cuisine to dishes inspired by the cuisine of different countries with an interesting gastronomy.\n",
      "Ideal for sharing. All very good. And very nice inner courtyard space.\n",
      "All very good! It stings a little in your pocket, but it‚Äôs worth it.\n",
      "Beautiful restaurant with excellent cuisine and friendly service. Especially locals as customers, which benefits the atmosphere in Barcelona overrun by tourists.\n",
      "Very kind. Food of 10.\n",

      "They wanted to charge me more. They also argued with me and insulted me. I have never had such a bad experience. They have not been able to explain me because what they charge is not in the letter. The only explanation I have heard \"Lord the menu is very small, we can not put everything we have\". That seemed ridiculous. When they asked for a receipt, they did not give it to me either. I will file a complaint at City Hall as well.\n",

It is not very big and it is better to make a reservation in advance. There are dishes of all kinds, more throwing on tapas than classic dishes. Well presented. There is a menu there was also a special menu when we were there. Prices are not particularly expensive, for the area and the 5 stars of the hotel. Nice place with bar and kitchen open to customers.\n",

      "Topchik. We sat down to have a snack and drink sangria (very tasty and beautiful serving). Very tasty ham and vertebrae with tomatoes.\n",
      "Good food but very slow in serving, perhaps because there was only one waitress.We said we would pay for the entire menu of the day \"by taking 2 dishes instead of 3, but we were forced to pay for the dishes individually and therefore the price has risen considerably.The place is chic and central\n",
      "I liked the word of mouth of the Japanese, so I asked him on the evening of the first day of Barcelona. Many tapas are all delicious. Roasted sheep shoulder, guinea fowl and soft and taste just right. Glass wine is also delicious.The last day is also a stop, squid, fried shrimp, mussels, etc. are all elaborate, all delicious. Spanish cuisine that is well prepared and elaborate but can be eaten casually.\n",
      "All delicious\n",
      "Great location, nice staff. We sat down from the only free table and unfortunately it was still very dirty from the previous guest. It wasn't cleaned either. Drinks were okay, we didn't eat anything.\n",

      "The place is very good. The star goes for attention. If you arrive within the schedule they have to serve. With the difficulties that the hospitality industry is going through, it is not understood according to what things ... If you go out to make an expense there must be people willing to earn it üò≥üòâ\n",
      "Lunch menu of ‚Ç¨ 16.80, which only includes a half bottle of water as a drink. We ordered a glass of white wine and it cost us ‚Ç¨ 5.50. When asking the waiter, he treats us haughtily and unpleasant. Very small portions .. I do not recommend it to anyone\n",

      "Neat design, pleasant staff and short menu but quality products.\n",
      "For lunch, you can choose appetizer, main and dessert. We were offered a different food than the one we ordered, and when we complained, we made it if necessary, but it was a separate fee. Eventually, the dish that was ordered with an error was ordered, but the taste was normal. The point was lowered due to poor customer service.\n",
      "Culinary delights, for the eye as for the taste. Attentive service, nice and tasteful ambience.\n",
      "A beautiful place. They offer a midday menu during the week.\n",

      "Excellent at all levels. Very good service and a great variety of tapas with very innovative proposals.\n",
      "Consumption on the outdoor terrace is very expensive.\n",
      "Tapas all wonderful (a little surprising at first, we thought there was not too much tapas apart from the croquettes but in fact everything is tapas). Salmon, suckling pig, beef ravioli, cheese and coulant, everything was perfect :) and an adorable waiter!\n",
      "Excellent and centralThis restaurant apart from being in the heart of the city center, offers a very well elaborated gastronomy, both in presentation, taste, quality and price. All this goes according to and matches perfectly with the atmosphere and the service they offer.\n",
      "Very expensive!!!!! 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine 25.80 euros, on the terrace of Comtal street, which is not wonderful either. I honestly think it is incredible ...... The waitress told us that it is a hotel price ...... I will not return or recommend it to anyone, there are incredible places in Barcelona that are cheaper and better ....... I live in Barcelona and it seems like a joke\n",

      "Ristorante in a 5-star hotel next to the Palau de la Musica Catalana. It is said that lunch can be eaten cheaply on weekdays, but there are days when it is not offered. At night, there were many people who enjoyed the afterglow by returning to the concert hall. The restaurant is caelis's casual sister restaurant, which has one Michelin star in the same hotel and the food was delicious as you can expect from it. Some of the menu items used Japanese seasonings, such as miso and Japanese mayonnaise. However, the food was a little salty, as is often the case in Barcelona. I asked the dessert for crepe, but the orange sauce entangled in the crepe was too sweet to lose the ice cream.\n",
      "Argentinian bar, not bad\n",
      "Expensive nooo the followingee, hot star beer and at ‚Ç¨ 4.20 the median ... fatal\n",

      "Lunch is available for ‚Ç¨ 19.50. It seems to be popular with Japanese people, and many Japanese people came.\n",
      "Very good service, the staff GREAT and the food, well (we went very blind) is good, original but you know when you are in a \"posh\" restaurantWe were not going with the vision of a feast, but the dishes ...... SMALL.\n",
      "Level covers. Comfortable and conditioned place in the middle of the Gothic Quarter.\n",
      "As for the lunch menu, the set was reasonable, and the contents were appetizer, main, and dessert. The main meat was really good.I recommend it because it is very close to the Palau de la Musica Catalana and the location is easy to understand.\n",
      "Good place good food a little scarce who likes to eat friendly and professional staff\n",
      "Delicious food and very friendly staff. Very good cheesecake üòã\n",
      "I chose it to spend Christmas Eve and we were delighted. Fabulous ham and shrimp croquettes (‚Ç¨ 7 x 3 croquettes), very creamy and with just the right flavor. Christmas Eve's romantic dinner with Mom was topped off with tempura oysters with citrus mayonnaise, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãentrecote with Caf√© Paris sauce, steak tartare, and grilled squid with pork jowl and miso sauce. Everything great. Pleasantly surprised ü§©\n",
      "Ideal place for a break. Very friendly waiter.\n",
      "Excellent service and quality of food. Good recommendation.\n",
      "Nefarious service and it is illogical for them to charge before the end of the consumption without notifying that it is the company's policy, which produces rejection and therefore the lack of desire to return\n",
      "Creative informal restaurant. Quality dishes and tapas.\n",
      "Good kitchen\n",
      "Very very good !\n",
      "Car, but food is worth it. Very original, tasty and different. Excessively expensive wines.\n",
      "Restaurant discovered by chance, I went there at the beginning of the week to have lunch in French time: The advantage of this moment of the day is the calm of the establishment and the availability of the waiters outside the rush hour. The menu of the day is very correct and well served, the price is in adequacy with the quality of the dishes and the portions. The cuisine is well prepared and the dishes are tasty, well balanced in terms of taste and beautifully presented which does not spoil anything. One downside concerns the wine, I was served a Bottle Bottle that had made these days. I will definitely return, however, and I recommend.\n",
      "I share the previous review. Two clear 8.80 without lid. It is an abuse and I explain why there are free tables, of course. The waitress a charm I hope they raise her salary with what they charge us because she is continuously serving any client.\n",
      "Very good food, original and with a fantastic treatment! We will be back!\n",
      "Very good Tapas! Cheesecake excellent!\n",
      "My recommended .... üëç\n",

      "Delicious gourmet tapas\n",
      "Nice but terrible service and food not tasty\n",
      "For a hotel bar, it is not excessively expensive, a very very small menu, but all of very good quality and rich.\n",
      "Very expensive a cane 4.40 euros\n",
      "Good location\n",
      "I only have to say one thing, scam! 4 beers with lemon ‚Ç¨ 18.05‚Ç¨ 4.10 per barrel lemon beer + 1.65 terrace service (I understand that).It is a shame that there is not a set price for consumption, it cannot be that they charge you double than in any other bar / restaurant for something so simple.\n",
      "Add a menu that never describes the menu in English. The taste is not bad, but it was not good to not speak English even though it was a hotel restaurant. Even most small cafes were ordered in English.\n",
      "We went to this restaurant almost by mistake but it was a great success. A spacious interior space that is very well conditioned in every way. The terrace is even more recommended. The service is very good. The food is very good and the prices are not cheap but they are in line with all of the above and with the area where it is located. A good experience despite not being our environment.\n",
      "A very nice restaurant.It is a restaurant with a very nice interior decoration, which invites to a leisurely conversation with family or friends.The outdoor terrace is very nice and of good dimensions, perfect for a drink at sunset.The menu is correct and varied, with a clear Mediterranean influence. The rations are correct in size with a good presentation. The wine list is also properly extensive and diverse.The dessert is great, especially the remarkable \"Lemon pie\", really amazing.Parking in the area is easy on weekends, as it is outside the city center, the location is great because it is easy to get in and out of the city without major complications and traffic congestion.Of course, it is not a cheap restaurant and the cost of lunch or dinner will be above average. But due to the environment, exquisite treatment of all staff and quality of food, it is not a negative point ... You will pay for what you receive.\n",
      "For a long time it had been a benchmark for us. Local with a very cozy terrace and good food to share. This last time it was a bit disappointing, the dishes did not surprise us (except for the octopus which was tremendous, the other dishes were not very elaborate) and the price quite high for what we ate, considering that we were 2 people and everything to nibble with. 4 glasses of wine and desserts a total of ‚Ç¨ 100 seems exaggerated and more in these times. We will think about it when repeating.Of course, the two waiters who attended us were very friendly and helpful\n",
      "Nice restaurant with spectacular terrace and friendly service. The food is expensive but quite expensive if you order a la carte.\n",
      "A good terrace is a consolation, when you are desperate looking for space to eat outdoors. The letters have been digitized and narrowed all in one to speed up the lack of staff. Although it is not a bad idea to offer fewer dishes but much better prepared. I like the proposal less food, more dish and better prepared.\n",
      "If you are looking for a quiet, elegant place, designed with taste and with versatile spaces in the heart of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãgo to Santa Clara.Ideal for a drink or lunch, for a greeting as a couple or a small group or for hosting large groups (work, friend, activity) without losing the intimate atmosphere of the meeting. Very professional, pleasant and correct service. Correct menu and you can suggest that they prepare menus for groups. Without a doubt to repeat.\n",
      "Nice space for a meeting of friends. Good offer of Group Menu. Good service and attention.\n",
      "Very nice and quiet place.I ate outside and the tables were well spaced from one another.The restaurant is very nice in every detail. The staff is very very kind. Right menu as a quantity. The tempting dishes made the choice difficult: meat, fish, pasta and appetizers.I opted for a good piece of beef, on a bed of asparagus and peppers, all perfectly cooked. The butter melted on the steak was very good.As a dessert I chose ricotta with honey and dried fruit. The red wine recommended by the head room is excellent.I highly recommend it and hope to return soon.Again congratulations to the staff.\n",
      "Very nice and very efficient staff, good food\n",
      "What style, both inside and in the large outdoor space. A pleasure both to eat out in the warm seasons and in front of the fireplace in the colder ones. Top restaurant, dishes of excellent quality. Abundant and punctual staff, high prices but worth it.\n",
      "I've been hungry, the cheese salad with arugula has been ridiculous, and the rice with mushrooms very good, but they make you very little, I have satiated my hunger by eating bread with oil\n",
      "Magnificent Restaurant to enjoy good food in a quiet atmosphere. Recommended food in the porch tables or on the terrace.\n",
      "A large, very cozy terrace. A great site\n",
      "Quality expensive price\n",
      "All very well\n",
      "Cozy restaurant with easy parking in the area. Relaxing and pleasant decoration. Extensive menu and correct half-day menu with well-made and imaginative dishes. Cuisine that dominates meat and fish well. Correct cellar. Professional and attentive service. A place with a magnificent relationship between quality, perceived only by entering and price.\n",
      "A drink or a meal in a quiet place. Good cuisine, the best octopus\n",
      "The site and space are ideal. Without a doubt, one of my favorite terraces in Barcelona. I do not give 5 stars for the price, since with some things, in my opinion, they go a bit and on the other hand, the service is very friendly, but they usually take a long time to attend. I comment it as an aspect of improvement, it is a site, that despite these 2 trifles, I highly recommend, without a doubt it is great, and obviously, I will return.\n",
      "I recommend\n",
      "A beautiful place, taking care of even the smallest detail of decoration. We decided to be inside and we were attracted by the tables with sofas that are very comfortable. The treatment of the staff was excellent, we felt very well taken care of at all times.We do not give the 5 stars for food, maybe we do not hit the dishes. We ordered steamed mussels to share that they were good. Of second I asked for duck magret that was also good, but my partner asked for rice and the truth was that it left a lot to be desired. They also presented it directly with alioli, something that surprised us because we usually associate it more with fideu√†.Except this little detail, all great, so we will certainly repeat.\n",
      "A treatment to improve on the part of the waiters in the service of the terrace, little in keeping with the image of the place.\n",
      "Very nice and good service.\n",
      "Excellent food with Basque airs but above all the attention and affectionate treatment of Nuria and Nico. Warm atmosphere that invites you to relax and enjoy the delicious delicacies. Accessible lunch menu, very good lamb and choco brownie with nougat ice cream !! My main restaurant in Barcelona.\n",
      "Don't order rice\n",
      "We had a great dinner, for a little ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨\n",
      "Terrific. Lovely terrace. Premium level\n",
      "Good quality and service but excessive price. Fair rations. Not so great wines for the price.\n",
      "Whenever we have been, the staff does not attend, they take more than 30 minutes we have to get up and go inside to notify - even with few people. The place is cute but inside a little intimate the terrace is the best.And the food is very correct.\n",
      "Very quiet place with a terrace, good service, and a good executive menu.\n",
      "The setting is superb for nibbling on croquettas and having a drink on a somewhat hidden terrace, preserved from the street. The staff is very kind.The food is good, but it's not exceptional.\n",
      "We had the food from San Esteban and they got on very well.It has different spaces and to go with family or a large group is fine.The terrace is huge.We went to St. Stephen's for lunch and they gave us a very good time. The space is very large and they have private dining rooms. They have a beautiful terrace to take in something.Good restaurant. The service was very good, also the food. They have private dining room if you are looking for discretion. I'll recommend it\n",
      "Place with large landscaped and ventilated outdoor area with sufficiently spaced tables. Very friendly service, simple menu and for all tastes, quality and correct price\n",
      "I love this restaurant. The executive lunch menu is well worth it and the terrace and interior are great ;-)\n",
      "The food is ok but the price too high in my humble opinion\n",
      "I recommend 100% ... the queue in front of the restaurant for lunch speaks for itself ...\n",
      "The terrace is quiet and very pleasant. Quality food.\n",
      "Nothing from the other world ...\n",
      "Because of the large outdoor terrace it has, especially in summer it is a marvel in part because it is private and cannot be accessed if it is not, from inside the restaurant.The good attention of the staff and availability and integrity above all to explain the menu well and recommend you\n",
      "Very good meat!\n",
      "It is an elegant place without being demanding, where you can enjoy a meal with friends or family\n",

      "Neither fu nor fa, moreover very expensive\n",

      "A pleasant place with good cuisine, the menu is a bit short.\n",
      "Cool!! 100% recommendable\n",
      "One of my favorite places to have a drink. The terrace is large and the atmosphere is very good. I recommend it 100%\n",
      "The 500gr ribeye was 100gr, the croquettes were not what they said. We were deceived\n",
      "Great place, but the food just the opposite. We paid 160 for three people, who would pay for it if the food was worth it, but of all the requested dishes the only dish that is saved is the sirloin tataki.The salmon tataki doesn't taste like anything, the Iberian secret hasn't left meat on the plate for a long time, the fresh foie gras micuit taken out of the plastic, the chicken croquettes are far from the best, they tasted more like carrot qa chicken, octopus and passable squid, dry bread, and Mahou beer.He had been there a long time and I remembered him much better. No desire to go back.\n",
      "A hotel restaurant, although it doesn't look like it. The very spacious terrace and a very nice waitress in particular. We ordered 4 dishes to share, salad, rice, cheese board and squid. A little raised in price for 4 tapas to share.\n",

      "Excellent menu, atmosphere and service\n",
      "A restaurant off the beaten track, located in an uptown area, which by itself has built a great reputation. It is also accompanied by a \"boutique\" hotel that these times of pandemic could be a solution for dinners that take longer than allowed for diners who are not staying. It is difficult to maintain the level of a restaurant and a hotel at the same time without, one hurting the other in the level of customer expectations. This site achieves it on a high note.The restaurant itself has a large garden with tables arranged at a considerable distance and enough space between diners to avoid any contagion.Regarding, the letter is not risky in itself but it fulfills its purpose with quality without detracting from the very reason for meeting. All this makes it a very satisfying dinner or lunch in all aspects.If I have not awarded the 5 star it is for a shallow and slightly innovative letter.What has been said before, the property maintains a fair balance between the environment, the food and the hotel, where the meeting around the table becomes more important.\n",
      "Good deal but too expensive for what they offer you. Normal quality and excessive price.\n",
      "Very good deal, quiet and good food\n",

      "Very delicious local cuisine! The restaurant has a good atmosphere! The speed of cooking is quite fast!\n",
      "I went to eat Menu del Dia. I didn't know it was weekend. So I ate 23.9 set weekend. The conclusion is satisfactory. It was surprisingly good. But it's very nice. It's 23.9 with drinks. It's a decent price. I recommend it because you can eat it in a friendly atmosphere at an affordable price.\n",
      "Lunch course not even 12 euros. Value for money is not bad. The restaurant and atmosphere are good.Avoid only aglio olio in the starter, spaghettiThe cream potato you see in the picture? Feel it but taste itThe main dish is beef, pork with onions and mushrooms? That's delicious. I recommend the plate with the yellow sauce in the middle in the picture.\n",

The appetizer, the main course, the dessert, and the drink were originally around 12 euros, but I wanted to eat Iberico steak for 4,5 euros and it was really awesome. The meat melted in my mouth and was soft Is there an Iberico steak? I recommend you eat it now !!!!!!! And the atmosphere is as good as a good restaurant and the food was served quickly and quickly.

      "Perfect, very well attended and the menu is super correct. It is advisable.\n",
      "worst. It's a waste of stars too. The duck came out, but the knife was hard enough (first picture). It's worse than having left the chicken 5 times. What did this mean? I took it straight away without saying anything and did it again.Surprisingly, I'm sure you know this is wrong in the kitchen. It looks like you're going to Menu del Dia a lot. Other than this, I made a seafood paella and BBQ vegetable. Shine of Shine of Shine. Please avoid it „Ö† „Ö†\n",
      "We went to lunch menu today, the truth is that everything was very good.One negative thing is that I burned myself with the pan, they don't put a plate on you, it's the same pan that makes you a plate and it comes out of the oven, it's my fault, but even if they warn you the handles come out and it's very easy to grab the napkin or cup and touch the pan.Price, very correct quality, ‚Ç¨ 13.90 the menu.They have vegetarian option and also for celiacs.The service lacks our language.\n",
      "I had a great menu. Very attentive treatment by the restaurant staff.\n",
      "Good value for money. Good atmosphere and good foodRavioli for appetizer, meat w potatoes & vegetables for main, and lemon sherbet for dessert (forgot the picture) It was a dish with money added, but it was still cheap haha ‚Äã‚ÄãThe staff are also friendly~ One employee didn't understand cava (here, wine or water course) (Included in the list. Kava is not included.) It may be a problem with my pronunciation lol I quickly called another employee and ordered a cava. Here, like in Korea, I go to the cash register and pay.\n",
      "We went for a business dinner with a closed menu, great experience! Eat plenty of quality!\n",

      "I have been to eat at this place with my boyfriend. Food nothing to write home about, I'm sorry to say that I didn't like meat. Staff not very friendly. The menu was only in Catalan and English, and I, who am Italian, understood little or nothing. Nice place and good price.\n",

      "The excellent attention, the very pleasant atmosphere, the highly recommended tasting menu with special mention for the Catalan cream, which is not the typical one, it is ... sublime !! Don't forget to ask for it. The negative note is for the bread that we did not expressly order (thinking, with good judgment, that it was a lot of food to add bread to it) but they still charged it ... 6 ‚Ç¨ 2 servings of bread with oil v.e. (very good looking).\n",
      "Good food, very well served.\n",
      "I remember when we collaborated with pep del Castell de L'Oliver, Mr. Marcos, Carles Gaig and his son, at mass weddings, the good opinions of all the diners where the best of traditional Catalan food was provided. It continues to preserve the best of before with the best of now, it is like having returned to the origin, to the Horta neighborhood, to that family establishment that evolved from populism to popular haute cuisine, giving it that touch of innovation where it is reinvented for the third time and he sets the bar high for those who precede him.Without a doubt one of the best representatives of Catalan gastronomy.A 5 ***** experience\n",
      "The restaurant maintains the essence of Gaig as always. Plates well elaborated and with product of quality. The elegant and inviting place, the unbeatable service, friendly and attentive. Returning to the dishes, in our case we have chosen the essential cannelloni truffles, dish that can never be missed. Also a seafood rice that has made us lick our fingers. To finish an exquisite oxtail fillet and a hake to garlic garlic that made mourning how good it was. The dessert has been a Catalan cream version Gaig! We must say that we have opened the dinner with a olivada and a pumpkin cream very good. All this has been a great experience. Sure to repeat!\n",
      "Very good experience !!! Traditional cuisine with good product. The Roman squid is delicious and so are the rice mushrooms and pigeons.Splendid gutters with truffle sauce.Well everything is very good. The wines are well priced and the treatment exquisite and very professional\n",
      "We went to a group of 6 (3 pairs), before the reserved time, but we all felt very attentive, both personally and by Carles Gaig, and very satisfied with the different dishes. The price is not reduced, but it is justified by the quality and service.\n",
      "Simply EXTRAORDINARY.My son and I went to eat, and the attention was perfect and the food was exquisite, especially the Arroz de Pich√≥n.\n",

We have eaten dishes of the menu and starters, according to, desserts and coffee has left us for ‚Ç¨ 50 per beard.It is worth to bet for restaurants of all the life.However, we have missed explaining some of the dishes, such as \"our Catalan cream.\"Repeat sure!\n",

      "Disappointing cuisine We chose the \"traditional menu\".Ostres Marennes: nothing plural. An oyster Very rich, but ONE.Tony tartare: we agree to consider it as \"very fragrant\".We have eaten it several times in Ametlla de Mar and it is served delicious.Cannelloni That, ONE. Tiny. Rich but scarce.A \"tastet\" of llobarro.Garri cruixent: also a little, we will not feel bad. We found the flavor of garr√≠ too strong.Good for dessert. Rich and enough.A chocolate macaron.We leave at ‚Ç¨ 93 / diner, with VAT, wine, glass of cava and coffee.We will not return and I do not recommend it\n",

      "Gaig as a brand astonishes, it has extensive experience in traditional Catalan cuisine behind it, and this has been the case, with cooking in just the right measure, generous portions in almost all servings (the Roman-style squid have seemed short, literally 7 rings ), the shrimp carpaccio is very good, but where they have slipped a bit has been in the service, details such as, a beer with too much foam, too much I mean in the middle of the glass, that we lacked bread for a long time or that the that a coffee that accidentally spills on the table and the waiters have not noticed at any time, has made us leave with the feeling that the room was not up to the kitchen level, for everything else, good.\n",

      "Galician restaurant! Quick and friendly service. Good quality price.\n",
      "Very good and good quantities, the only thing that should improve is the bread, they put an old bread that breaks teeth without toasting or anything, a place like that should at least have a good tomato bread, since there is practically nothing else on the menu , bravas and Padr√≥n peppers to accompany seafood and meats.\n",

      "Very good deal, and unsurpassed pop\n",
      "Very good restaurant, with high quality dishes, I especially recommend the octopus, one of the best I have eaten in my life!\n",
      "We started with the wine and once we served it the glasses were dirty, we ordered the octopus and it was good, after an hour of waiting for the pan, we claimed it and we were told that they were returning it to do. We left without finishing lunch. They have not been up to par..\n",
      "Seafood for every taste, a huge selection of dishes at very affordable prices. But, octopus, frankly, was not impressed. Maybe because he himself was so bad or cooked. Therefore, if for the first time, take a quarter for the experiment. Everything else was delicious - the most tender squid in batter, I recommend the batter without an egg, it is less fat. And spicy clams in white wine and garlic sauce - you will lick your fingers!\n",
      "Taberna Galician, Seafood store. Good quality and lots of it. Friendly service. I recommend the octopus, and the seafood. Galician ear was also very good and very tasty De Santiago cake. Good price. recommendable\n",
      "Taking into account the standing of the menu, the place is quite simple. Letter a bit concise. But without a doubt of the best quality.\n",
      "Galician cuisine restaurant with a top quality product, very good service and excellent service.Everything I have eaten every time we go is very good.The place is cozy although when there are many people quite noisy.Price per person 45-65 ‚Ç¨\n",
      "The trusted Galician‚ù§ Great seafood, ham and cheese and delicious meat. Have a pomace cream afterwards!\n",
      "It is usually crowded and the place is not very large, so it is advisable to book.It may seem that prices are not cheap, but, the portions are large! And the food very good!\n",
      "A good choice, it eats very well, the portions are full, and at a reasonable price for the quantity and quality, the friendly staff, especially the waiter who has served us, may be grateful for some solution to the heat that it gives the separation of the terrace, because to the black being, when it gives the sun, it seems a stove\n",
      "The \"but\" is the waitress who served us, bland and stale in the deal. The scallops are spectacular in size and flavor, the octopus is very rich, although it is not with cachelos, it is with cooked potato apart. First class meat, so generally recommended, good value for money. Excessively broad menu.\n",
      "Excellent quality is worth the price, .very large quantities we hope will not change\n",
      "One of my favorite places to enjoy Galicia in Barcelona! There is nothing out of expectation. The portions are beautiful and blunt! All Galician classics with quality and without waiting once seated, but yes: I recommend calling and booking since at rush hour it is going to burst and you can wait 1 hour quietly at the bar, although with a beer and a little ham It makes more fun! The price is relevant for the cuisine they offer. I will ALWAYS repeat!\n",
      "Very good.exvelent lying i tracte\n",
      "Very good place for all the customer service, especially Miss Rosa, who was the one who attended me and the spectacular food, thank you.\n",

      "The octopus is very good! In general everything. Great service.\n",
      "Good service and very good value for money. What is clear is that you are not hungry.\n",
      "Good Galician restaurant well known in the area.\n",
      "The place is very central in the Eixample.The product very rich and of origin although perhaps some oil is left over.The staff a bit slow but there are many people, some mistake is understandable.With the desserts and coffees we have left a little price although if you save it it is very competitive.Recommended octopus with mackerel.We will repeat.\n",
      "Very rewarding experience and great food with good üëå Staff and a good price.\n",
      "For a long time I wanted to go at the insistence of friends and the truth is that it has not disappointed me, the truth is that it is brutal, good service, reasonable price and extensive menu, 100% recommendedA great pleasure !!!!!!!\n",
      "The best value for money, especially if you like seafood (indispensable octopus, mussels and razors). Better go there for more than 4 to try more dishes as the portions are huge. Desserts could be better (save the tiramisu).\n",
      "A bustling and friendly environment where you will find a kitchen that exceeds efficiency, in the same way that the dishes exceed generosity. It is not a defect, it is a characteristic that must be taken into account when ordering. From a tomato bread executed with exquisite sensitivity, which is rare today, to an octopus as tender as a mermaid's kiss. Scallops are treated like queens. The list can go on. The service is friendly, patient, and efficient.\n",
      "Excellent food, very good attention. Super recommended\n",
      "Delicious wines.Original and very tasty food (except for 2 croquettes that came out a little ... frozen. Hence a score of 4/5)Excellent service, very friendly waiters and always with good advice.\n",
      "A very pleasant and attentive treatment without getting heavy. It was our birthday and we got the place right. A complete menu and a good selection of wines\n",
      "Cozy place with two spaces. One in the background for dinner at small tables (couples), and one in front with high tables and some larger to share, or eat even at the bar. To taste wines of all types, and also eat some things to accompany. I recommend the toast, we ordered several and they were all great. Also if you like wine, they will attend you and recommend you well. Located in El Barrio del Borne, I will definitely return.\n",
      "A very nice place and with good attention from the waiters and waitresses. Letter with little variety.The food was delicious but we lacked some amount for the price which I consider to be quite high. They offer you desserts when finished: ‚Ç¨ 5 a frozen chocolate cake ...I do not think I'll come back.\n",
      "I have returned today after a long time and it is still a lovely place. The toasts are delicious, the portions are adequate and the atmosphere is super calm and cozy. The staff are very friendly and advise you well :)\n",
      "Incredibly pretty place with cozy, dim lights.The food is quite simple and consists of tapas and torradas (hot or cold). Everything is very tasty and the staff shows that they are clearly prepared.The wine list is extensive and surely if you let yourself be recommended you will be right. The chocolate dessert is a delight for the palate.I think it is a place to go with your partner, since the atmosphere helps to have a very quiet evening.I'll probably be back.\n",
      "The place is cozy. Friendly waiters speak several languages. They do not have many tables, and they are close together. The relationship quality price acceptable.\n",
      "We had a very good dinner: a nibble and then toast. They also serve cocktails (quite \"soft\" to my taste. Good atmosphere.\n",
      "Recommended, very good roasts, especially the aubergine and the ham with orange sauce\n",
      "The treatment and customer service is spectacular, they make you feel at home. The atmosphere and the food very good, we took several dishes to share and we loved them. The wine was great. We will return for sure.\n",
      "Nice atmosphere, correct and attentive service, good food but nothing to highlight. They could improve the relationship quality price of wines to glasses they have.\n",
      "Perfect place !! Excellent atmosphere! Super staff! A 10!\n",
      "A pleasure, great selection of wines, super nice atmosphere in not the most emblematic neighborhoods of the city, thank you for your attention!\n",
      "Barcelona has enjoyed since 2012 a new temple dedicated to wine, the most illustrious of all concoctions. It is called Disset 17 Graus (the temperature, they say, at which such a precious liquid must be served). Located in the Born district and decorated with unquestionable good taste, Disset 17 Graus shines on those shelves stocked with beautiful and slender bottles that greet visitors from their very entrance.Judith Ardite (sommelier and head manager, as well as a charming woman) says that the idea was to create a specialized wine bar that was comfortable, friendly and affordable for all budgets.\n",
      "Excellent wine list and sommelier! The place is very nice and they have tapas to accompany. Totally recommended!\n",
      "All great. Original recipes\n",
      "Everything excellent, service the super friendly and charismatic people the super rich food and great atmosphere.\n",
      "A super cozy place. The very good tapas, minus the octopus and the butifarra torrada hehehe, which do not do as is Galician as it says on the menu and the butifarra is black pudding. But the waiters are super nice, the atmosphere of both the local and the great clientele, the spectacular area, the food except for a few things is great. So a 9.5 hehe üòòüòò\n",
      "Very welcoming. Good wineüç∑\n",
      "Ideal\n",
      "You reserve a table at 15:30, you arrive at the place and neither table nor anything. They don't even take care of you. They have given the table to other users. And on top of that they do not respect any covid norm. The owner at the bar without a mask and with nothing. And in the kitchen, more of the same.[UPGRADE]The food is very tasty and because of the incident, the owner has invited us for drinks. The quantities also very large.\n",
      "Small but cozy typical Colombian restaurant, excellent food, very friendly, helpful and courteous treatment, the waitress spectacularly attentive!The only downside to be put is the little space between tables.\n",
      "We went to eat at noon having reserved a table and everything was correct. There it was reserved.Hearty food. PAISA tray and drink ‚Ç¨ 16.50 per person. Reasonably normal. Tables a bit tight, but the place is small.A detail that I really liked that they came to sing a duo with Colombian songs. Out of 10, some cracks.\n",
      "Daily menu of ‚Ç¨ 10.50. Abundant. Colombian food. Good quality. You can't ask for more for that price.\n",
      "The food in general is good and in the spoon dishes I recommend ordering medium since it comes a lot, the empanadas are very very good, there are starters that the Sazon is the same for all the flavor of fajitas, the smoothie is very rich but they put a very good jar on you. big but full of ice, the waitresses a bit stale, the cook and the guy at the bar, quite the opposite, very nice, they leave you with empty plates and things on the table and they don't take it away you eat a little overwhelmed, patac√≥n with cheese ‚Ç¨ 7 And all the cheese that it brings does not cover even half a patac√≥n since they are large and they put 3 and two mini pieces of cheese only in the two top patacones that you see on the 3rd you find it underneath without cheese.\n",
      "Spectacular, although I think the dishes are quite generous in case they are not eaten a lot, ask to share .. I felt in Colombia and more so with the serenade that the countrymen gave us üíú 11 out of 10\n",
      "Delicious, and very good service\n",
      "that rico because\n",
      "Excellent place to enjoy authentic Colombian food. I have been to many Colombian restaurants and of course La Fonda Paisa is in the top 3 of the best. The seafood casserole was delicious, not to mention the homemade consomm√© which had a unique flavor.We were lucky enough to go one day when there were some musicians who played some typical string music, which made the experience much more enjoyable.I will repeat.\n",
      "Good food, nice presentation, but the attention to the public leaves much to be desired, the restaurant is small and they hurry me to leave. I wanted dessert and I couldn't have it, because without asking for the bill they brought it to me.\n",
      "Always my pleasure\n",
      "Very rich everything\n",
      "Menu of the day (beef steak / steak) and paisa tray both very good. Great natural juices at a good price.Good overall experience. The site is small with many tables and is often crowded making it difficult to follow COVID-19 measures.\n",
      "All very good, nice and very friendly staff. 100% recommendable!\n",
      "Colombian food restaurant. Great value for the price. Large portions, fresh and flavored with Colombia.I recommend the paisa tray and the mango and soursop juices.It is a small place but easy to locate near La Sagrada Familia. We had been here 3 years ago and decided to repeat. It was worth it!Good attention. Quiet atmosphere.\n",
      "I had better expectations when I went in for dinnerThe mini-size paisa tray has not been any wonder since the arepa came dry and cold. Half a banana and hardly any meatI found her if she was a little betterThe Perfect Beer is cold and the dessert is a little better so we will try to come back another day to see if it convinces us\n",
      "A cozy place with a warm atmosphere, although he thought it was small\n",
      "The food was ok. The price was really high. An aguadepanela 3 euros I imagine it is designed for tourists but it seemed high price to me. The cozy place and the girl very friendlyThe food was delicious.\n",

      "‚ÄúSaint Esteban Day‚Äù following Christmas is also a holiday, and many shops were closed, but ‚ÄúLa fonda paisa‚Äù was open.I felt warmth easily from the small shop, so I entered without hesitation.Ordered 13.95 ‚Ç¨ fish and 1.9 ‚Ç¨ beer. The soup containing chicken such as liver and chicken wings came out first and this was delicious. Fish dishes are snappers! They are well baked and delicious. It went well with beer and ordered another beer.17.75 ‚Ç¨ in total. I am very satisfied.\n",
      "Excellent place to remember our country. Recommended ... The only thing is that it is permanently quite crowded with people and you have to wait a bit. But the wait is worth it. Delicious food...\n",

      "Delicious everything ü§§\n",
      "Very tasty and abundant Colombian food, reasonable price, somewhat more expensive than normal, but it must be said that it is difficult to finish a typical Colombian dish. I have been going to this restaurant for about 15 years, during these years they have never had the smallest detail, they have hardly spoken to me, if it is true perhaps they are very serious but I miss some sympathy. For this reason and only for this reason I have removed the missing star, keeping the four.\n",

      "The food is tasty, but we have asked for an address that took more than an hour to arrive and they charged me at 5.50 without having told me when I called.Terrible service! They call me to yell at me because it turns out that the client claims not to be informed that they charge such an expensive address, there are many places where they do not charge the address, why assume that you are and so expensive! To top it off, totally disrespectful to yell and disrespect a customer!And if it is far away say it, we charge so much, that is a bad service that does not clarify things, as if they had to take everything for granted! They have no idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcustomer service!First and only time I will eat from your restaurant! They make Colombia look bad with that service!

      "Today I went to dinner at the local Travessera de Gracia. The rich food, the cordial attention, the super attentive waiter.But the manager will make them lose many customers. Bad ways to tell us that they were closing and that we should leave because it was 0:00Before our comment that was more cordial, he told us \"well, here I warn you like this\" \"we closed 23.30 so we gave them plenty of time\" ...An unpleasant, bad mannered and confronts customers. An example of everything there is no contract to deal with customers and have attention to the publicI don't think I'll come back. Good luck!\n",
      "Going to Tagliatella is having a party, everyone always likes everything and we hope to return soon\n",
      "Nice staff. Very good service. It needs a remodel in the decoration. There are already many modern Tagliatella\n",
      "Excellent quality, attention and prices. Very good variety and totally recommended to those who love good pasta and good pizzas. You will not regret it!\n",
      "Like there often. As fast food of Italian food it is fine.\n",
      "We wanted to eat Italian and we were served. Good, but no more. Pizza is better than pasta.\n",
      "The pizza is very good ... something fine for me, but it is tasty.\n",
      "Service quite slow and not very pleasant. When we called to book we asked if they had gluten free alternatives and they said yes. These alternatives were fusilli pasta with four cheese sauce or Neapolitan sauce, which is basically fried tomato. This pasta was served with a rather unpleasant presentation, the pasta was caked and the flavor left a lot to be desired. To give this type of gluten-free service it is better that they do not offer anything.As for the rest of the dishes, the truth is that it improves the thing a lot, the pizzas and pasta are good, but as an Italian, it is not the best, it is still a chain of restaurants.\n",
      "I go from time to time, but the times that I have gone with my partner have been very good. We usually leave a plate of pasta and a pizza and with that we stay very well .. although sometimes it falls dessert, but they are very complete and fill you up. The 3 times we have gone have been satisfactory, I recommend it!\n",
      "Good restaurant and good quality for family and friends gatherings.\n",
      "The truth is that all the tagliatella restaurants are the same, both in decoration and menus, but if I give this star 5 it is because the service was good despite having the place quite full and also the dishes they served us were as always excellent .I love the tagliatella salad with mango and basil sauce and the Chocofondente dessert, which is a mascarpone cream with liquid and solid chocolate with a result that I really like.The letter in Spanish, something that should not be remarkable but that is not everywhere in this place, is appreciated.\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "The service is excellent, the Sorrentine dish was not to my liking. They have served me ravioli instead of sorrentinos, and I don't recommend the 4 cheese sauce.I will give it another chance with other dishes because the place is beautiful and has good service. I still had bad luck with the choice of foods to my liking.\n",
      "I really liked the service it was excellent at all times also the food was very delicious !!! A highly recommended place to have fun with friends, as a couple and with the family. #travelagentbarcelona\n",
      "Good place to go as a family !!\n",
      "You try to reserve a table by the fork, it gives you a choice but it doesn't let you select. When you call they do not respond, and when you show up there and comment on it they tell you that they have blocked the app for a long time and that is why they do not know that you reserve there.They ‚Äúdid us a favor‚Äù by sitting at a table in the corner near the kitchen door, where waiters could be seen coming out with their masks down and pulling them up when they opened the doors.The table without napkins or cutlery, and they put bread and drink like that, we had to ask for them when the dishes arrived at the time of ordering.The food, well, it's the worst restaurant in the chain by far, I asked for a well done tenderloin and it even came with charcoal from the grill, but one of the pieces that were thicker was raw, anyway! Pregnant that I cannot eat raw meat and had to leave me half because of poor cooking.\n",
      "Good place, classic decoration like all tagliatella, good food, fine and crispy pizzas, good spicy oil, good and well presented desserts, good value for money, ideal for families and groups.\n",

      "Tasty and exquisite typical Italian dishes\n",
      "Pizza too thin very good !!The fast and very attentive service.\n",
      "Apparently the waiter does not like large groups and with little tact and wanting to finish he asked us in a hurry ... A smile would appease.\n",
      "Good food, complete pasta dish .. The only downside is that as a dessert there is no custard or yogurt !! Typical dessert xls small. If they have couland and tyramine or ice cream\n",
      "I loved the attention the Italian waitress very attentive everything\n",
      "Excellent service. Good food. Generous servings. Adjusted Price.Very correct anticovid measures. Good Sep\n",
      "The boy with blue eyes, curly hair and ... Argentine? Attention 10/10. Nice but not invasive. Thanks!\n",
      "A disaster. The extra buonna was missing half the ingredients and the two mini-slices of tomato and the sweet ham thrown away reluctantly. The two pizzas half done. I do not recommend it, it has lost the quality it had.Thanks for the reply. We will not go again.\n",
      "Excellent pizzeria. Whenever I can, I will have a good strong pizza. The products and the quality are always very good, whatever Tagliatella you go to. The pasta dishes are very abundant even to share. You can ask for the leftovers to take away :) And the desserts are also very good, crocanttino :) I'll be back!\n",
      "Good and plentiful food but a bit pricey\n",
      "They have changed the menu, although some dishes from the old menu I liked a lot, they have to be renewed\n",
      "Delicious pizzas. Can not complain. Price performance, ok!\n",
      "We have had a good, fast and good dinner.The waiter who served us (a middle-aged man) was very attentive, kind and friendly.The close treatment in a food chain is appreciated.\n",
      "a classic\n",
      "Good Italian type restaurant, like all tagliatelle.Very generous and good quality servings.Spectacular desserts!The service is very friendly and they always serve us quickly and with a smile.Finally, the application they have to accumulate points and exchange them for gifts is a point in favor to repeat.Delighted to go assiduously!\n",
      "The last time we went, they put a lot of food on us but the quality of the food can be improved. Thanks anyway.\n",
      "Very good quality and service\n",
      "Excellent meats and pasta\n",
      "The place is nice and spacious. The service is careful and attentive. They have a great variety of pastas and sauces. The price is fair.\n",
      "Typical Tagliatella restaurant. Lunch and very good pizzas. Good service. But there is nothing for lactose intolerant people.\n",
      "Pizza pate fine as in Italy, just excellent!\n",
      "The food is very good, the treatment is not too good it was 15:30 and they gave us a prey to order and snoop because they told us that at 16:30 they closed .... fatal schedule !!!\n",
      "Excellent attention in a super nice environment\n",
      "Happy, very good treatment as always !!!\n",

      "Filipino food restaurant, great value for money! very good food! good service, we loved it! we will be back! the place is not exceptional but if you want to try Filipino food I recommend it.\n",
      "Very good Filipino food, very friendly and excellent value for money. Extensive menu, we will return to try more dishes!\n",
      "Very good food. Some things were missing from the menu, for that reason I do not give them the 5 stars. Filipinos feel at home. Very good chicken adobo.\n",
      "The truth is that this place was better before, I have waited 30 min for the drink and 15 after the food (local only half full) and the food consisted of chicken bones with a little meat and reheated in the microwave, .. being the national dish I expected more. I will not come back\n",
      "You eat very well in this restaurant.Good food and good treatment with customers.Every time we go down to Barcelona we always stop here to eat.I recommend it 100%\n",
      "The food was good but the place doesn't have much space.\n",
      "I love authentic restaurants, without costumes or fusions. This is one of them. Authentic Filipino food and a very varied menu. Salads, greaves, soups, suckling pig, pork in all its variants and Filipino desserts. The atmosphere is that of the Philippine community here in Barcelona. The treatment is very kind. The place is a dining room with about ten tables, something simple and familiar. We will repeat!\n",
      "Super rich and cheap food! It is a discovery and I save it for many more occasions. I have tried new things and I loved all the dishes that the waiter recommended. We have eaten for 25 euros between 2 people with a drink and we have not been able to finish it all, because the portions are very abundant.\n",
      "Good flavor meat and vegetable noodles, chopsuey with vegetables to the point, meat spring rolls and crunchy vegetables, in general we liked the freshness of their vegetables, soft flavors and very good service.\n",
      "Good restaurant / bar of Filipino food. The service to the customer is good. The food is very good. The price quality is very adequate.\n",
      "This restaurant has been recommended to me by a Filipino lady, who leads a team of 5 chefs and 3 helpers, also her countrymen, who work in the home of a very influential family in Barcelona. The wait has been almost 30 minutes long, but it is understandable that the restaurant was very crowded at 14.00 rush hour. I was very surprised that nobody complained, they waited patiently for them to be served, families with children, couples, workers, tourists. Suddenly the food began to come out completing tables. There are no words to describe how immensely good and how well presented the dish was. Well yes very very very good.A quality and an incredible price, it is worth moving from the opposite point of Barcelona or coming from far away expressly, because it does not disappoint and leaves no one indifferent. Restaurants in Barcelona are raffled to Filipino chefs, they sign chefs from the Asian country for their expertise in preparing classic and modern dishes of Spanish cuisine.They are reputed to be honest, reliable, hardworking and above all to know how to trace the recipes with extreme precision. I will discover and try more dishes and especially their typical Halo Halo star dessert.\n",
      "Good food, good price and a correct treatment, I will return\n",
      "Unusually horrible!Beef soup with huge chunks of corned beef, cartilage and connective tissue, chunks of veggie too big to fit on the spoon, made with less of the strictly rudimental cure. In edible for a European palate! A total delusion! :-)\n",
      "Ideal to know the flavors of the Philippines, recommended BBQ. Very economical !\n",
      "Nice local, very attentive. The excellent cuisine üëèüèæüòâ\n",
      "Excellent food I had never tasted Filipino I liked it a lot\n",
      "Los Hermanos Restaurante (c / Villaroel, 26) is a small and cozy place, as well as clean. Great variety of Filipino food and everything is delicious, excellent value for money. It fills your stomach so much that you don't get hungry for many hours! The waiting time for your order to arrive is correct (10-15 min). The staff are very friendly and hard-working. Today was the first time I went but I will repeat more times, alone or with company. 100% recommendable. Thank you dear countrymen!\n",
      "It leaves much to be desired:-Slow service.-Lots of variety of food but most of it is not available.\n",
      "Very good Filipino food, to repeat.\n",
      "Every time I go to this restaurant I enjoy myself. I am a fan of Filipino food.\n",

      "Authentic Filipino restaurant. Very good food and excellent treatment.\n",
      "Small restaurant, but well used. The food is exquisite. The only downside to it is that table service has been a bit slow, because the waiter was alone to serve the tables, the bar, and pick up the dirty dishes.Acceptable prices and correct portions.We will be back for sure!\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Varied food and very good treatment\n",

      "Great typical Filipino food restaurant! Frequented by Filipinos and with very good service. To repeat whenever possible!\n",
      "Excellent food. We ordered several dishes to share and they all met our expectations. Good attention and speed in bringing the dishes. Highly recommended\n",
      "Very good food. Super tight price. The poor waiter had too many tasks, but he was friendly.\n",
      "Quality excellent price. Homemade restaurant with great Filipino food. I will be back.\n",
      "Nice and cheap good Filipino food. A more than recommended site! The 4 times I've been, we were the only non-Filipinos in the place, that's worth proof that they serve authentic Filipino food. The waiters help you and advise you with the dishes\n",
      "Food with very good taste.Good attention.But the site is very small so the 3 stars\n",
      "Filipino where the Filipinos eat, will be for something ... Hahahaha The food is very good, with strong portions and at a good price. Between 5 and 6 euros you can take one of their combinations. Small place but of all the times that I have gone, yes, I have repeated, I have always had room. The perfect deal and they serve fast.\n",
      "Very authentic, very good Filipino food deal in a place full of Filipino people living in cat, we really liked it, we will be back. Price ok\n",
      "Excellent! We ordered Kare Kare and one of the pastas. The peanut sauce is very good. And the shrimp sauce too. Simple, relaxed and cheap, high quality food.\n",
      "Very good typical Filipino food. We saw it in passing and on the outside it does not seem very good, but the food and friendliness of the owners is very good. We left at ‚Ç¨ 10 per head and the portions were spreading. I will repeat for sure!\n",
      "The food made us feel bad, straight to the bathroom. In addition, it took 1 hour to serve it, and on top of that it seemed that we could not sit when they had 3 empty tables.Very expensive drink. Second's food.\n",
      "Good food and the employees treat you very well!Authentic Filipino food.\n",
      "Simple place, but very good Filipino cuisine at reasonable prices\n",
      "If you want to savor authentic Filipino cuisine, visit this restaurant.\n",
      "I don't know ... just like that. It was with high expectations and the food without more ... The normal fried rolls: fried and crispy. The national dish, which is a chicken in sauce, was like the beer chicken my mother made for me. It was good, but I was looking for different flavors. And then the good noodles ... but also not to drive me crazy.In its favor: It was Tuesday night, and it was full of Asian people. That must count. I think we did not choose well!\n",
      "Thanks for los hermanos especially to sir lewis ... Feels like home .... Thanks .. More blessings ....\n",
      "Normal place but Filipino food very very rich and very economical.\n",
      "An incredible meal in a calm and relaxed atmosphere.\n",

      "Great Filipino food.\n",
      "Loose food, language problems. Few dishes\n",
      "I am on vacation in Barcelona and I was very disappointed with the restaurants in Barcelona serving tapas and other Spanish specialties. My mother being Filipino wanted to try a Filipino restaurant. We found this one, and we weren't disappointed. Authentic, good food. The prices are very affordable. The smiling waiters. I totally recommend it! Generous and quality portions! Salamat!\n",

      "I loved it and everything was super delicious. Especially sushi üç£. Good atmosphere\n",
      "Well suited for wheelchairs. High tables that enter the legs. Lunch menu at 13 E with first, second, drink and dessert. The salad very rich. Ramen very rich and quite generous (noodles especially). The wine was very correct to be on the menu. I treat friendly and quite fast. Highly recommended.\n",
      "The menu is very good, ‚Ç¨ 13 and in addition to being all good the quantity is abundant. The place is nice although the tables are too close together. It is usually full. The service is not very fast but it is not too slow and it is worth it.\n",
      "I think that the kitchen is Chinese, and the locals are good ~ I like the taste a little bit, but it seems to be okay. It is more delicious than Korean Ramen house. It is not carrots. It is about as much as it is in Spain. And Yakisoba is not soba noodles. I was very disappointed with the way I saw it on the Hatton Nippon Family Mart.\n",
      "Very friendly staff. Bright and cozy place. Great food!\n",
      "Normal ... they took a long time to bring the ramen\n",
      "Good restaurant, good service and very well priced. Fast and attentive. Very good food, the prawns the sushi, the gyozes, the dessert all delicious! Too bad we went for the ramen and maybe it was the weakest, good, but there are better ramens in BCN, but overall the food is delicious and the restaurant very nice.\n",

      "Good lunch menu, fast service. The restaurant is Chinese but they sell Japanese food, still passable food. The delicious mochis!\n",
      "The place is cozy. In the letter it says that you can consult gluten-free dishes, but when you ask workers about it, none of them knows how to answer you. They have ramen with rice noodles, but I don't know for sure if a celiac could take them. The gyozas, rich, the ramen also well, although the canons did not hit me on it.The waiters are not well organized, since one of them tried to charge us again once we had already paid.\n",
      "All a very good product quality discovery, fast and helpful.\n",
      "Restaurant specializing in ramen, but also in the menu you can find other dishes such as sushi, noodles without soup or rice dishes.They have two noon menus: one with entree, main course, dessert and drink and another equal, but without entree.The service is fast, but if you are looking for more quality in terms of ramen, there are many more options for Barcelona and at similar prices.\n",
      "Very friendly, good service, good food and very reasonable price\n",
      "good enough. reasonable price for being barcelona. (no to japan or taiwan)\n",
      "Restaurant with a calm and cozy atmosphere. The food is fine, the gyozas and karague are the same that you could make yourself if you buy them in an oriental supermarket. The quality of the fish is good, especially the Unagi Don eel. In summary, a place to taste daily Japanese food with acceptable price quality.The restaurant is run by non-Japanese people.\n",
      "It is right in front of the hostel and I ate the own ramen and smile ramen! 9.5 euros I was really satisfied I smile a little bit, but I do not own any of them and the chachu is really thick and it is really delicious „Ö† I have made sushi and rolls on the spot and it looks good.However, if you do not order it, you will have to pay for it at 2.6 euros.It is still delicious!\n",
      "An ideal place to discover Japanese food\n",
      "Awesome. Of all the Japanese food outlets, this one is in the top 5 by far. The onigiri chasu is spectacular. The ramen are a delight and the divine takoyakis. The place is cozy and the service is impeccable. Super recommended. Super quality / price. ‚Ç¨ 15 / person on average.\n",
      "Excellent. We tried many things and all very rich. I recommend the takoyaki for snacks! The place has a cool decoration and the service was very good. Super attentive and friendly. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Spectacular, and I definitely recommend the curry 10/10. We will repeat.\n",
      "From the chain of responsibility. Good and fast.\n",
      "Very nice and clean place, very well prepared food and affordable prices, I recommend!\n",
      "Noodles okay.\n",
      "Small but cozy place, waiters a bit scattered (at least the day we went), all served very quickly.As for the food all quite good, with lots, the ramen is delicious, and we also ordered sushi to try but for my taste, the nigiri a little big for my taste, too much rice. But otherwise great.\n",
      "Very good ramen although little variety. Little chasu although delicious.I recommend ordering only one dish if you order ramen, unless you are a big fan.\n",
      "Order pork bone Sapporo ramen and dumplings. Tonkotsu ramen was seafood-based rather than pork bones. Dumplings are normal, but the sauce is soy sauce-based and has a slightly different taste.The price was about 15 ‚Ç¨ including drinks and the taste was reasonable. However, I was disappointed with the difference in taste because I wanted to eat Japanese food.\n",
      "Speed, all great and very good attentionüòä\n",
      "I want to eat hot soup in Europe!\n",
      "Nice place, very good service, the ramen is fine.\n",
      "Service quite fast, the taste of Ramen quite achieved. There are more things that are also rich. Price-quality correct.\n",
      "Ramen House has become our most practical Ramen spot. The location is good, and the place is tastefully decorated, mixing a traditional, modern and elegant style. Inside you are calm and comfortable, even on weekdays when it gets crowded thanks to the affordable and complete lunch menu on offer.The staff is also quite friendly and attentive.About the food, apart from different ramen dishes they also offer sauteed noodles, rice, sushi, onigiri and different starters and desserts. The quality of the ramen, to my taste, is medium - high, although it is worth saying that the value for money in general is very correct, as the complete dishes range from around ‚Ç¨ 7 to ‚Ç¨ 10 approx. I would especially recommend the Chashu Onigiri. We have come as a couple, with friends and also family. The place and its menu adapt perfectly. We are happy with Ramen House and we hope that they keep moving forward and improving along those lines! :)\n",
      "Good ramen, tasty meat and additions. Minus for the pasta, which was very much and I liked it on average.\n",
      "The ramen is very good, it has nothing to envy to the Ya-Hiro. The attention is very good and they attend quickly.\n",
      "Food and exceptional treatment. Adequate price Totally recommended.\n",
      "Very good everything. Ramen, 3 starters and mochi for 20 euros each. Good value for money\n",
      "Delicious shoyu ramen!\n",
      "A restaurant where I accidentally entered the broth in Basel!It was so delicious to eat the soup after a long time.Not much is known yet, so there weren't many customers.It seems to be good when you think of the broth.\n",
      "Good place for dinner, friendly waiters and exquisite food. They close something soon.\n",
      "They have a very complete menu for ‚Ç¨ 12. The ramen is very rich but my favorite dish is the chicken karagee (chicken coated with vegetables with curry and rice). The desserts are simpler and careful during the week because if it is full the service tends to go somewhat slow.\n",
      "Ramen good and at a good price in the Center. Although for me its star dish is curry rice.\n",
      "Good food, good price and a cozy place\n",
      "All very tasty.\n",
      "A must-try Japanese restaurant. It is not the typical place we are used to. In a small and cozy place where you have to reserve. It does not stand out for its sushi but for the variety of typical dishes they have. If you like Japanese food at the right price, this is the place.\n",
      "A different Japanese and good products. A little expensive\n",
      "We went with high expectations due to the excellent reviews and recommendations but the truth is that although we ate well, it was just good. Except for the sashimi which we found to be excellent, none of the dishes were the ones that you say mmmm while you savor it.\n",
      "Clean, fast place, nice service, good quantity, and of course, delicious. We will be back without a doubt!\n",
      "Without a doubt my favorite restaurant! I discovered it by chance and I have stopped counting the times I go.The fusion between Mediterranean and Japanese food is super original and the quality is incredible. I encourage you to try all the dishes, and above all I join all the recommendations on the green tea tiramisuü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§.\n",
      "Japanese cuisine restaurant, with amazing dishes that make it a whole culinary experience ... Attention to tempura and tuna tataki ... Spectacular ...\n",
      "Small restaurant but a lot of people.Great Japanese food\n",
      "Long ago Can Kenji resounded. Today I had the pleasure of trying it. The migdia menu is great, I leave you photos. I only wanted to have a tasting menu with them even more. Super accessible prices and very good quality, presentation and attention.A 10 out of 10\n",
      "Maybe I expected more because it had very good reviews. The place is small with horrible acoustics and dirty walls, a little painting would not be bad. There is so much noise that you do not hear your companion. We ordered several dishes, the nagiris and the tataki were good. Nothing special for my taste.\n",
      "The best are the niguiris and makis, we have ordered horse tataki of very good quality and tasty.What was not successful was the vegetable tempura, too oily.The service is fine but the place is very noisy and makes you not enjoy dinner.\n",
      "The best Filipino I've had in all of BCN.Super recommended. A super simple and varied menu with prices that are not used to seeing, with generous portions. All prepared with a craft that is appreciated from the first moment. I recommend the chicken with coconut sauce, a delight. The staff is super attentive and, despite the difficulties of the moment, they have treated us super well. To return and recommend !!\n",
      "Surprise the quality of the food for the price you pay. Elaborate and delicious dishes, everything I have tried has pleasantly surprised me. My recommendation: kalderetang baka, a spicy beef stew.\n",
      "Excellent place of typical Filipino food. I recommend it but the service a bit bland.\n",
      "All great !! Good service, attention and care, Salamat !! See you soon!!\n",
      "Good price. Attentive and quality !! Highly recommended Filipino food.x ‚Ç¨ 55 we had dinner 4 trying all kinds of dishes and desserts\n",
      "Very good value food. The attention too. I found it an authentic place of traditional Filipino food\n",
      "Very rich Filipino food :)\n",
      "Good service and meal\n",
      "They are very friendly and the food is delicious !!\n",
      "I didn't know Filipino food and my verdict is that it's really good. It is a place where most clients are Filipinos and that says a lot about the quality and authenticity of the food. The staff is very friendly and helpful. recommendable\n",
      "Very good Filipino food and excellent price.\n",
      "Filipino cuisine very good and well priced. I recommend the chicken with coconut milk, delicious. The only bad thing is that they cut the bones so that there are many splinters mixed with the meat, and it bothers a little. It would be better to debone the meat before cutting it, or not to cut the bone in that way.\n",
      "Great!!!!! All great !!!\n",
      "If it is not 100% authentic, it is by far the one that comes closest to Philippine gastronomy. If you want to experience and get to know Philippine gastronomy, this is the place to visit. The prices are very good, the service varies depending on who attends you, but the set is great! Recommendable!!!\n",
      "Curious Filipino restaurant that I did not think of very Filipino decoration but rather neutral. I had a broth with chicken and very good rice. At first the letter is a bit scary for the lack of references but I'm sure everything is very good. And a great reference is the large number of Filipinos who eat there, which differentiates it from other themed restaurants aimed exclusively at the Spanish diner such as the Chinese and Japanese where you never see native people eating.And the prices very good, Chinese restaurant type. My broth did not reach ‚Ç¨ 6 and had a good amount and most dishes do not reach ‚Ç¨ 6. They also make take-out as was my case and the broth was in a bag and the bag in a well-covered container to avoid possible spills. I will be back.\n",
      "Excellent food at a good price. If you want to taste Filipino food, this is the right restaurant\n",
      "Great restaurant with Filipino food that although the menu makes you lose a bit, you know for sure, good variety and flavor, the service is neither quick nor slow.\n",
      "Restaurant with a friendly and familiar treatment. Filipino homemade food very similar to what my mother prepared for me as a child. Combine the traditional with new dishes. The Dinoguan with white rice is my favorite dish. But the meat rolls are spectacular.\n",
      "It is Filipino home cooking. There are many dishes to order, some even add new ones. The service is very friendly.\n",
      "The food is very good and the establishment is clean, and the waiter is very nice and polite. The place is very cozy indeed.\n",
      "I've been several times and everything is great ... Crunchy chicken, meat and vegetable rolls, sweet chorizos, all homemade and a charming service at an unbeatable price.Everything can be ordered with rice and egg to make a combined dish for a price of less than ‚Ç¨ 7 ...\n",
      "Pretty good, we were a group of 20 celebrating a birthday and for ~ 10 eur per person we were all full, plus the food is very good.\n",
      "Good price, normal food is nothing to write home about, the flan is the best.\n",
      "Very good and good service\n",
      "Very good place and food need to improve the service a bit quickly.\n",
      "Super rich and very cheap food.\n",
      "Good and cheap. Excellent attention. Difficult to park by car.\n",
      "Hmmmm ... safe\n",
      "Great everything. My favorite Filipino restaurant.\n",
      "There are few Filipino restaurants in Barcelona and the menus are very similar. This has the peculiarity of being on a wide street and being able to get there easily by car, instead of walking down the narrow streets below. The best of the menu is the kawali and pansit suckling pig (in this and in any other Filipino restaurant). If you prefer a combination dish, the litsilog or tosilog.\n",
      "I don't trust these people, I had a problem and nobody knows anything.\n",
      "Very rich and tasty food, a real discovery!\n",
      "I am Latino and I love Filipino food !!!\n",

      "Very good pasta! Abundant and rich dishes. Very good attention!!\n",
      "As always, the Tagliatella does not fail. Delicious food and large portions. My low rating does not go to the chain or its dishes, but to the staff of this headquarters.I went with my partner to dinner, at past eight, after they had just opened. The restaurant was empty and despite this the two waiters who were there were very unpleasant. When it came time to serve us, they did so with an idleness and a little grace that removes the desire to repeat. Airs of superiority and inadequate treatment. When we were leaving, another couple arrived, and despite the fact that the restaurant was still completely empty, the treatment they gave was the same.I hope that some manager reads this, because surely it was not the first time nor will it be the last that they dispense this treatment to clients.A shame to put this assessment but anyway, if someone does not value the job they have, they should not have it.\n",
      "We went through this restaurant to pick up an order from the app that we already had in charge of (and that no restaurant in our area has according to the app itself), and not only did they tell us that they didn't have it, but they lied to us about some things about the I will not go into detail (we have been customers of the Taggliatella for many years and I know well how everything is going).As a final note, I will say that almost every time I come to Barcelona city I end up having unpleasant experiences in restaurants, while in the metropolitan area the staff and managers are much more friendly and attentive.\n",
      "I still have water in my mouth when I think about it. We are very well received, in addition to eating well. If I had more time I would have gone around the restaurants of the sign. üòòüòòüòç\n",
      "Pasta, pizza and rich dessert. Good attention\n",
      "Friendly and fast service. We went to eat one weekday at 2.30pm and they had to close at 3.30pm due to restrictions, they attended to us without problems and very efficiently. We were able to eat at ease and in the time available. The restaurants of this chain are somewhat expensive but the food and the quantity are good.\n",
      "Well, totally passable, I think that pasta for what it's worth is nothing to write home about. I have eaten at many better Italians.\n",
      "I didn't like the pasta dish I ordered. Triangole with a cheese sauce that made me sick while I ate it and throughout the afternoon.I will return to Tagliatella but not for the last meal.Correct and very efficient servicePrice a bit expensive for lunch, 20 euros for a beer, a plate of pasta and a coffee.I hoped that I would have liked everything better and sat better.Bad luck for me this time!\n",
      "Right service but 15 minutes after ordering they tell us they don't have one of the dishes. 45 minutes after entering still waiting for food.\n",
      "A Tagliatella place quite small for what I am used to when visiting these franchises. The decoration is exactly the same as always and is very neat and very beautiful. The treatment of the waiters and all the workers is excellent as always. The prices we are used to are a bit high although the value for money is reasonable.\n",
      "As always very good, this is to ensure a good dinner, I'm a fan of a pasta dish with prawns that I love, sorrentino with gambieri, I find it brutal, and all tagliatella make it the same. Maybe the place is one of the least caring I've been to, but in general, everything is very good. The service is also very correct.\n",
      "When you don't like fish ... this is the place for some great pastas! Good price, quantity and flavor üëå\n",
      "The restaurant was very busy. The pizza was good, not the pasta. We have asked to take a plate to go, and they have told us that we will have to wait. I don't know what. Very expensive prices for what it is, a transparent pizza. The waiters very overwhelmed and eager to attend fair. We will not return the truth.\n",
      "The food and the treatment was great. The waiter very friendly. We ordered a puff pastry entree stuffed with cheese with caramelized eggplant and tomato jam that was crazy good.And the great pizzas, big and very good. With crunchy pasta, as I like it.\n",
      "Excellent cuisine. Perfect home.\n",
      "Correct. Service maybe a little slow but attentive. Quality and price of food, the usual.\n",
      "The citio is very cozy. Very friendly waiters too !! Good price and very good food. Anyway, what I think of this citio that here you can eat quietly for ‚Ç¨ 50 - 2 pax. And very good!!\n",
      "Excellent service and food. It has a very elegant and clean style.\n",
      "Great service.\n",
      "They have treated us very well, like at home. Excellent food and we haven't waited long.\n",

      "Functional food without surprises, good service, good pizzas, as in my case, I went with children and pizza-ice cream is a victory combo.\n",
      "Excellent Italian pasta, hearty dish and good service. It is not entirely economic, but it is very good. He has earned the score well. The cheesecake is very rich too.\n",
      "Friendly welcome. Map offered in French ... it helps! Pleasant surroundings. Varied dishes. Ravioli: tortellone caprese (basil cheese) with calabrese sauce: tomato pinion garlic onion basil ... very good and plentiful.The downside was the pizza melanzana: eggplant honey tomato mozzarella parmesan balsamic vinegar. Thick paste like a cigarette leaf and seasonings: paint to color everything. 5 thin strips of eggplant. Final thickness 3 mm. For me no taste of pizza even if the dough was good.\n",
      "It is not a quality Italian restaurant. It is not worth it for those who love real Italian food (a pizza ‚Ç¨ 14). I recommend other restaurants than this franchise.No me ha gustado nada por el precio excesivo. Esto no es comida italiana yes no tra√≠da ya hecha en un cami√≥n !!\n",
      "Not bad. Hearty dishes\n",
      "Yesterday 02/14 we went to eat with my partner. I give it two stars for a waiter named David who at least saved the service a bit. We had a table reserved at 2:30 pm, but since we were walking around the area, we went earlier. Luck. When we arrived there was a queue, and no one was controlling access (people sneaked in without respecting the order of arrival). Once inside, about a quarter to 3, it was a disaster. There were only 2 waiters for the whole restaurant. And that is not the fault of the kids, but of the person who runs this Tagliatella. I find it shameful that on such an important date, that everyone knows there will be an influx, there are only two people to do all the work. From here, all wrong. The tables were not assembled, no type of organization, there was no orange fanta (?), No risotto ... I ordered some tortellini and it was the most bland thing I have ever eaten at the Tagliatella. At least my partner's pizza was correct. We were lucky, since David attended us super fast and well, but there was a couple by our side who when we left (they had arrived almost at the same time as us) still did not even have a drink. The truth is that I never go back to this Tagliatella, not even fed up with wine. I have never witnessed such a service in my entire life (and I am a waitress), and I write this complaint not for the poor waiters, but for the unpresentable who runs this place.\n",
      "This people just want to rip you off, ‚Ç¨ 13 for a pizza with ham and half an egg is not acceptable.It seems that we want to apply the diet. A calzone of ‚Ç¨ 13 and are unable to give content. A locha of ham and half an egg.I live next door and I will never return to any restaurant in the chain, honestly if these people intend to live from others other than tourists they will have to improve and much.\n",
      "Good Italian cuisine, charming waiter and good professional\n",
      "Terrible service. More than an hour waiting. We had a reservation for the fork and the reservation had not arrived. A 0\n",
      "Good attention, very good food. A pizza, a pasta and 2 waters have cost ‚Ç¨ 32\n",
      "What else can I say that is no longer said by everyone else? Another Tagliatella with the magnificent varieties of pasta and cheese.\n",
      "The first and second dishes are very good and good.The best desserts. The ice cream chocolate was Nutella, not suitable to my taste. The management of the fatal reserve. Having arranged the Diada lunch in advance, we reached the agreed time and we did not have a table. They improvised one on the first floor that was in the middle of the passage. Every time a person passed, he hit the table. The delay in serving was desperate. Entering at 2:00 PM we left at 4:45 PM without drinking coffee. It is necessary to improve the management of tables, the dining room service and the reservations. Strangely as it is a Tagliatella where, normally, all this is well resolved ...Received the answer (of commitment ...) of the property, I have seen other previous reviews with which I come to the conclusion that what fails is the management of the local manager. That brave lord some other local guides speak of. Just add that on the 11/19/19, when on the first floor there were three tables (about 25 people) stressed to leave when they waited for the coffees and the note, the bald lord in question was quietly eating at the ground floor in the rooms four in the afternoon. Is it the best time?\n",
      "It needs urgent reforms. Local a little run down.\n",
      "It never disappoints, no matter which one you are in, it's just as good\n",
      "All great, excellent treatment although the price is somewhat high.\n",
      "Eat insipid Cold, and afterwards reheated with microwaves. Let someone who says cook cooks a plate of pasta and meat in the microwave says a lot of the place. The provoletta did not like anything. The waitress has failed many times. And they did not want to give us the gift for points.\n",
      "Attention and excellent food !!!\n",
      "Very friendly and fast service. Eat right, if you ask for pasta or puzzles. Don't order meat or fish. Enough drink. They have no great assortment of quality beers or wines.\n",
      "We have received very bad attention from the staff.\n",
      "It only has the name of Italian. NON Italian chef, non Italian food, non Italian waiters. I strongly advise against it\n",
      "The quality and quantity is very good. The waiters very friendly.\n",
      "Excellent pizzas, which we receive all at once. Very friendly and efficient service. It's nice to feel comfortable when you go to a restaurant with children.\n",
      "Food just like any other Tagliatella. The bad score is because one of the waiters tried to surpass the line of \"friendship\" by making some jokes that neither came to mind nor were funny, rather they were heavy. Beyond that, the food arrived slowly, the pizzas cold and they forgot a couple of drinks\n",
      "Chain of restaurants that pretend to be Italian restaurants. Low quality food and not similar to Italian cuisine.\n",
      "Very very nice surprise!Arrived here by chance, everything was very good. Good product and a very good boy. He's Italian in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbut he's a very good Italian.\n",
      "Very good food. Pizza wafer thin and crispy. Desserts very good. Nice atmosphere.Nice service. Completely satisfied.\n",
      "We went and we were like 12, the place was overflowing, but they managed to make room for us.As for the food, I thought it was excellent, very good and at its point.The only thing that would change is the letter, make it a little more descriptive or with images of each pizza\n",
      "Plentiful dishes that give p two, very reasonable prices. Good service.\n",
      "Huge pasta dishes. That what you eat over you can eat\n",
      "My first time at this franchise restaurant. But as always a safe heat with children.Kindness, speed and food although simple, always at your point.\n",
      "A place to eat or dine typical dishes of Italian cuisine.Very attentive, friendly and helpful service.The price is a little high but it is worth it to spend a nice time with friends or family.\n",
      "Have you ever seen eggplants in oil and in vinegar in the pasta alla norma? Unfortunately, I am in this restaurant which has NOTHING Italian. Avoid it if you want to eat Italian, honestly.\n",
      "very good tasting pastas, nice place to eat, good service, very good service.\n",
      "Very good service. The pasta is very good.\n",
      "I like here !! very nice and delicious. the bacon pizza is soooo good tast. but rissoto was little salty. but the mushroom small was very gorgeous The risotto is a bit salty but it's good to order less salty when ordering. Bacon Tomato Pizza? It's got walnuts and texture\n",
      "Very good pasta, delicious pizzas and very good treatment.\n",
      "Good quality food and the midweek menu a great deal to take advantage of.\n",
      "The food was very good, they treated us very kindly. We ordered the daily menu that they have and excellent the price and the menu. I also ordered the Japanese tea and very good\n",
      "I loved it and everything was super delicious. Especially sushi üç£. Good atmosphere\n",
      "Well suited for wheelchairs. High tables that enter the legs. Lunch menu at 13 E with first, second, drink and dessert. The salad very rich. Ramen very rich and quite generous (noodles especially). The wine was very correct to be on the menu. I treat friendly and quite fast. Highly recommended.\n",
      "The menu is very good, ‚Ç¨ 13 and in addition to being all good the quantity is abundant. The place is nice although the tables are too close together. It is usually full. The service is not very fast but it is not too slow and it is worth it.\n",
      "I think that the kitchen is Chinese, and the locals are good ~ I like the taste a little bit, but it seems to be okay. It is more delicious than Korean Ramen house. It is not carrots. It is about as much as it is in Spain. And Yakisoba is not soba noodles. I was very disappointed with the way I saw it on the Hatton Nippon Family Mart.\n",
      "Very friendly staff. Bright and cozy place. Great food!\n",
      "Normal ... they took a long time to bring the ramen\n",
      "Good restaurant, good service and very well priced. Fast and attentive. Very good food, the prawns the sushi, the gyozes, the dessert all delicious! Too bad we went for the ramen and maybe it was the weakest, good, but there are better ramens in BCN, but overall the food is delicious and the restaurant very nice.\n",
      "Very good service, excellent food! We have had a good time and we leave with a happy stomach üòÅWe will be back, we have no doubt!\n",
      "Very good service, everything explained very well! Very large portions and very tasty :)5 stars absolutely deserved!I would love to come back!\n",

      "Very good quality food, the place is also clean and beautiful\n",
      "Good lunch menu, fast service. The restaurant is Chinese but they sell Japanese food, still passable food. The delicious mochis!\n",
      "The place is cozy. In the letter it says that you can consult gluten-free dishes, but when you ask workers about it, none of them knows how to answer you. They have ramen with rice noodles, but I don't know for sure if a celiac could take them. The gyozas, rich, the ramen also well, although the canons did not hit me on it.The waiters are not well organized, since one of them tried to charge us again once we had already paid.\n",
      "All a very good product quality discovery, fast and helpful.\n",
      "Restaurant specializing in ramen, but also in the menu you can find other dishes such as sushi, noodles without soup or rice dishes.They have two noon menus: one with entree, main course, dessert and drink and another equal, but without entree.The service is fast, but if you are looking for more quality in terms of ramen, there are many more options for Barcelona and at similar prices.\n",
      "Very friendly, good service, good food and very reasonable price\n",
      "good enough. reasonable price for being barcelona. (no to japan or taiwan)\n",
      "Restaurant with a calm and cozy atmosphere. The food is fine, the gyozas and karague are the same that you could make yourself if you buy them in an oriental supermarket. The quality of the fish is good, especially the Unagi Don eel. In summary, a place to taste daily Japanese food with acceptable price quality.The restaurant is run by non-Japanese people.\n",
      "It is right in front of the hostel and I ate the own ramen and smile ramen! 9.5 euros I was really satisfied I smile a little bit, but I do not own any of them and the chachu is really thick and it is really delicious „Ö† I have made sushi and rolls on the spot and it looks good.However, if you do not order it, you will have to pay for it at 2.6 euros.It is still delicious!\n",
      "An ideal place to discover Japanese food\n",
      "Awesome. Of all the Japanese food outlets, this one is in the top 5 by far. The onigiri chasu is spectacular. The ramen are a delight and the divine takoyakis. The place is cozy and the service is impeccable. Super recommended. Super quality / price. ‚Ç¨ 15 / person on average.\n",
      "Excellent. We tried many things and all very rich. I recommend the takoyaki for snacks! The place has a cool decoration and the service was very good. Super attentive and friendly. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Spectacular, and I definitely recommend the curry 10/10. We will repeat.\n",
      "From the chain of responsibility. Good and fast.\n",
      "Very nice and clean place, very well prepared food and affordable prices, I recommend!\n",
      "Noodles okay.\n",
      "Small but cozy place, waiters a bit scattered (at least the day we went), all served very quickly.As for the food all quite good, with lots, the ramen is delicious, and we also ordered sushi to try but for my taste, the nigiri a little big for my taste, too much rice. But otherwise great.\n",
      "Very good ramen although little variety. Little chasu although delicious.I recommend ordering only one dish if you order ramen, unless you are a big fan.\n",
      "Order pork bone Sapporo ramen and dumplings. Tonkotsu ramen was seafood-based rather than pork bones. Dumplings are normal, but the sauce is soy sauce-based and has a slightly different taste.The price was about 15 ‚Ç¨ including drinks and the taste was reasonable. However, I was disappointed with the difference in taste because I wanted to eat Japanese food.\n",
      "Speed, all great and very good attentionüòä\n",
      "I want to eat hot soup in Europe!\n",
      "Nice place, very good service, the ramen is fine.\n",
      "Service quite fast, the taste of Ramen quite achieved. There are more things that are also rich. Price-quality correct.\n",
      "Ramen House has become our most practical Ramen spot. The location is good, and the place is tastefully decorated, mixing a traditional, modern and elegant style. Inside you are calm and comfortable, even on weekdays when it gets crowded thanks to the affordable and complete lunch menu on offer.The staff is also quite friendly and attentive.About the food, apart from different ramen dishes they also offer sauteed noodles, rice, sushi, onigiri and different starters and desserts. The quality of the ramen, to my taste, is medium - high, although it is worth saying that the value for money in general is very correct, as the complete dishes range from around ‚Ç¨ 7 to ‚Ç¨ 10 approx. I would especially recommend the Chashu Onigiri. We have come as a couple, with friends and also family. The place and its menu adapt perfectly. We are happy with Ramen House and we hope that they keep moving forward and improving along those lines! :)\n",
      "Good ramen, tasty meat and additions. Minus for the pasta, which was very much and I liked it on average.\n",
      "The ramen is very good, it has nothing to envy to the Ya-Hiro. The attention is very good and they attend quickly.\n",
      "Food and exceptional treatment. Adequate price Totally recommended.\n",
      "Very good everything. Ramen, 3 starters and mochi for 20 euros each. Good value for money\n",
      "Delicious shoyu ramen!\n",
      "A restaurant where I accidentally entered the broth in Basel!It was so delicious to eat the soup after a long time.Not much is known yet, so there weren't many customers.It seems to be good when you think of the broth.\n",
      "Good place for dinner, friendly waiters and exquisite food. They close something soon.\n",
      "They have a very complete menu for ‚Ç¨ 12. The ramen is very rich but my favorite dish is the chicken karagee (chicken coated with vegetables with curry and rice). The desserts are simpler and careful during the week because if it is full the service tends to go somewhat slow.\n",
      "Ramen good and at a good price in the Center. Although for me its star dish is curry rice.\n",
      "Good food, good price and a cozy place\n",

      "Japanese cuisine restaurant, with amazing dishes that make it a whole culinary experience ... Attention to tempura and tuna tataki ... Spectacular ...\n",
      "Small restaurant but a lot of people.Great Japanese food\n",
      "Long ago Can Kenji resounded. Today I had the pleasure of trying it. The migdia menu is great, I leave you photos. I only wanted to have a tasting menu with them even more. Super accessible prices and very good quality, presentation and attention.A 10 out of 10\n",
      "Maybe I expected more because it had very good reviews. The place is small with horrible acoustics and dirty walls, a little painting would not be bad. There is so much noise that you do not hear your companion. We ordered several dishes, the nagiris and the tataki were good. Nothing special for my taste.\n",
      "The best are the niguiris and makis, we have ordered horse tataki of very good quality and tasty.What was not successful was the vegetable tempura, too oily.The service is fine but the place is very noisy and makes you not enjoy dinner.\n",
      "The best Filipino I've had in all of BCN.Super recommended. A super simple and varied menu with prices that are not used to seeing, with generous portions. All prepared with a craft that is appreciated from the first moment. I recommend the chicken with coconut sauce, a delight. The staff is super attentive and, despite the difficulties of the moment, they have treated us super well. To return and recommend !!\n",
      "Surprise the quality of the food for the price you pay. Elaborate and delicious dishes, everything I have tried has pleasantly surprised me. My recommendation: kalderetang baka, a spicy beef stew.\n",
      "Excellent place of typical Filipino food. I recommend it but the service a bit bland.\n",

      "Good service and meal\n",
      "They are very friendly and the food is delicious !!\n",
      "I didn't know Filipino food and my verdict is that it's really good. It is a place where most clients are Filipinos and that says a lot about the quality and authenticity of the food. The staff is very friendly and helpful. recommendable\n",
      "Very good Filipino food and excellent price.\n",
      "Filipino cuisine very good and well priced. I recommend the chicken with coconut milk, delicious. The only bad thing is that they cut the bones so that there are many splinters mixed with the meat, and it bothers a little. It would be better to debone the meat before cutting it, or not to cut the bone in that way.\n",
      "Great!!!!! All great !!!\n",
      "If it is not 100% authentic, it is by far the one that comes closest to Philippine gastronomy. If you want to experience and get to know Philippine gastronomy, this is the place to visit. The prices are very good, the service varies depending on who attends you, but the set is great! Recommendable!!!\n",
      "Curious Filipino restaurant that I did not think of very Filipino decoration but rather neutral. I had a broth with chicken and very good rice. At first the letter is a bit scary for the lack of references but I'm sure everything is very good. And a great reference is the large number of Filipinos who eat there, which differentiates it from other themed restaurants aimed exclusively at the Spanish diner such as the Chinese and Japanese where you never see native people eating.And the prices very good, Chinese restaurant type. My broth did not reach ‚Ç¨ 6 and had a good amount and most dishes do not reach ‚Ç¨ 6. They also make take-out as was my case and the broth was in a bag and the bag in a well-covered container to avoid possible spills. I will be back.\n",
      "Excellent food at a good price. If you want to taste Filipino food, this is the right restaurant\n",
      "Great restaurant with Filipino food that although the menu makes you lose a bit, you know for sure, good variety and flavor, the service is neither quick nor slow.\n",
      "Restaurant with a friendly and familiar treatment. Filipino homemade food very similar to what my mother prepared for me as a child. Combine the traditional with new dishes. The Dinoguan with white rice is my favorite dish. But the meat rolls are spectacular.\n",
      "It is Filipino home cooking. There are many dishes to order, some even add new ones. The service is very friendly.\n",
      "The food is very good and the establishment is clean, and the waiter is very nice and polite. The place is very cozy indeed.\n",
      "I've been several times and everything is great ... Crunchy chicken, meat and vegetable rolls, sweet chorizos, all homemade and a charming service at an unbeatable price.Everything can be ordered with rice and egg to make a combined dish for a price of less than ‚Ç¨ 7 ...\n",
      "Pretty good, we were a group of 20 celebrating a birthday and for ~ 10 eur per person we were all full, plus the food is very good.\n",
      "Good price, normal food is nothing to write home about, the flan is the best.\n",

      "Very good place and food need to improve the service a bit quickly.\n",
      "Super rich and very cheap food.\n",

      "Hmmmm ... safe\n",
      "Great everything. My favorite Filipino restaurant.\n",
      "There are few Filipino restaurants in Barcelona and the menus are very similar. This has the peculiarity of being on a wide street and being able to get there easily by car, instead of walking down the narrow streets below. The best of the menu is the kawali and pansit suckling pig (in this and in any other Filipino restaurant). If you prefer a combination dish, the litsilog or tosilog.\n",
      "I don't trust these people, I had a problem and nobody knows anything.\n",
      "Very rich and tasty food, a real discovery!\n",

Also, the portions are very generous.We went to dinner with some friends and it is perfect to share and be able to try different dishes.Without a doubt, a place to repeat!\n",
      "Both the octopus and the spectacular ear, I recommend you order them! It is not a cheap place but neither is it excessively expensive. Book early because you probably can't eat if not\n",
      "The portions are super abundant and very rich. The quality / price is very adequate. The rejos are the best dish on the menu. Very happy, I will repeat for sure.\n",
      "Spectacular Galician food !!! You cannot miss the octopus, razor clams and their homemade desserts!\n",

      "Thanks to the waitress who was very kind, we got the portions right as they are very abundant, we ate the octopus, anchovies and cuttlefish and it was all delicious! We will repeat for sure\n",
      "They never fail. Ordering octopus should be mandatory. The only thing to keep in mind is that the portions are large, so for two or three people, it is better to order half portions and not overdo it when ordering dishes.\n",
      "Galician restaurant! Quick and friendly service. Good quality price.\n",
      "Very good and good quantities, the only thing that should improve is the bread, they put an old bread that breaks teeth without toasting or anything, a place like that should at least have a good tomato bread, since there is practically nothing else on the menu , bravas and Padr√≥n peppers to accompany seafood and meats.\n",
      "Local-Setting: 7/10Service-Attention: 8/10Food-Drink: 8/10Quality-Price: 8/10\n",

      "Great quality, perfect staff\n",
      "Perfect as always. We had octopus, sirloin (brutal!), Squid and croquettes for dinner. All exquisite and above all the treatment of all the staff, but especially the room manager. Absolutely attentive, personable, and fantastic. Not 5 stars‚Ä¶ 10!\n",
      "Good food. Good service. Don't worry, they won't overwhelm you with the dishes, they are very helpful and nice. A good place to go with friends or family.\n",
      "Fabulous, if more. Excellent product, cooked and service. They don't go overboard with the prices and the portions are generous. The only downside is that it is very small and gets up to the top. it is well worth going and trying their excellent dishes\n",
      "The octopus is recommended, and the grandmother's cakeClams, razor clams, squid and other very fair qualityThe service is very fast, maybe even too much, the dishes pile up and in 30 minutes you have already had dinner, with coffee, the shot courtesy of the house.\n",
      "The best pulpos restaurant in Barcelona\n",
      "What a great restaurant. The first impression is typical of Spain because the lighting is too bright for Germans. But what in my experience stands for very good Spanish quality üòÉ The waiters were all very friendly and courteous. The food came quickly and hot despite the restaurant filling up very quickly. The most important thing is of course the taste and it was great. Will definitely come here for dinner again. Thank you!\n",
      "Very good, good value for money, although the place could be a bit cleaner.\n",
      "One of the best Galician food restaurants in Barcelona. The ear and the octopus, excellent.\n",
      "Good treatment, quality food and abundant.I have been many times with the family, it is ideal, the only downside is the prices a tad high if we would not go more often.\n",
      "Very good and very good! We love!\n",
      "Recommended 100%. Treatment received by Christofer incredible for his professionalism and kindness. All very well, better to make a reservation before going. Price for its quality corresponds to it.A mention for putting a but, are their oysters, they were a bit fair, it's the only thing that I think was not up to the task.\n",
      "The exceptional octopus, the very hot temperature inside, the correct waiters. The place could improve. The price / quality ratio is good.\n",
      "For me the best Galician in the area. TOP!\n",
      "Galician style food restaurant with good portions at a good price. The product is of Mirna quality, the service is correct. A recommended place to eat quantity at a good price and with a good product.\n",
      "A spectacular food Galician cuisine, good atmosphere very good service, good quality and price\n",
      "He has met the expectations of the other two where he had already been. But the waitress was very tied up and she didn't even tell us that they had Grandma's cake for dessert üòçSo when I saw her go by .... Bad for her but the restaurant was very good üòâ\n",

      "Very good deal, and unsurpassed pop\n",
      "Very good restaurant, with high quality dishes, I especially recommend the octopus, one of the best I have eaten in my life!\n",
      "We started with the wine and once we served it the glasses were dirty, we ordered the octopus and it was good, after an hour of waiting for the pan, we claimed it and we were told that they were returning it to do. We left without finishing lunch. They have not been up to par..\n",
      "Seafood for every taste, a huge selection of dishes at very affordable prices. But, octopus, frankly, was not impressed. Maybe because he himself was so bad or cooked. Therefore, if for the first time, take a quarter for the experiment. Everything else was delicious - the most tender squid in batter, I recommend the batter without an egg, it is less fat. And spicy clams in white wine and garlic sauce - you will lick your fingers!\n",
      "Taberna Galician, Seafood store. Good quality and lots of it. Friendly service. I recommend the octopus, and the seafood. Galician ear was also very good and very tasty De Santiago cake. Good price. recommendable\n",
      "Taking into account the standing of the menu, the place is quite simple. Letter a bit concise. But without a doubt of the best quality.\n",
      "Galician cuisine restaurant with a top quality product, very good service and excellent service.Everything I have eaten every time we go is very good.The place is cozy although when there are many people quite noisy.Price per person 45-65 ‚Ç¨\n",
      "The trusted Galician‚ù§ Great seafood, ham and cheese and delicious meat. Have a pomace cream afterwards!\n",
      "It is usually crowded and the place is not very large, so it is advisable to book.It may seem that prices are not cheap, but, the portions are large! And the food very good!\n",
      "A good choice, it eats very well, the portions are full, and at a reasonable price for the quantity and quality, the friendly staff, especially the waiter who has served us, may be grateful for some solution to the heat that it gives the separation of the terrace, because to the black being, when it gives the sun, it seems a stove\n",
      "The \"but\" is the waitress who served us, bland and stale in the deal. The scallops are spectacular in size and flavor, the octopus is very rich, although it is not with cachelos, it is with cooked potato apart. First class meat, so generally recommended, good value for money. Excessively broad menu.\n",
      "Excellent quality is worth the price, .very large quantities we hope will not change\n",
      "One of my favorite places to enjoy Galicia in Barcelona! There is nothing out of expectation. The portions are beautiful and blunt! All Galician classics with quality and without waiting once seated, but yes: I recommend calling and booking since at rush hour it is going to burst and you can wait 1 hour quietly at the bar, although with a beer and a little ham It makes more fun! The price is relevant for the cuisine they offer. I will ALWAYS repeat!\n",
      "Very good.exvelent lying i tracte\n",

      "Good Galician restaurant well known in the area.\n",
      "The place is very central in the Eixample.The product very rich and of origin although perhaps some oil is left over.The staff a bit slow but there are many people, some mistake is understandable.With the desserts and coffees we have left a little price although if you save it it is very competitive.Recommended octopus with mackerel.We will repeat.\n",
      "Very rewarding experience and great food with good üëå Staff and a good price.\n",
      "For a long time I wanted to go at the insistence of friends and the truth is that it has not disappointed me, the truth is that it is brutal, good service, reasonable price and extensive menu, 100% recommendedA great pleasure !!!!!!!\n",
      "The best value for money, especially if you like seafood (indispensable octopus, mussels and razors). Better go there for more than 4 to try more dishes as the portions are huge. Desserts could be better (save the tiramisu).\n",
      "A bustling and friendly environment where you will find a kitchen that exceeds efficiency, in the same way that the dishes exceed generosity. It is not a defect, it is a characteristic that must be taken into account when ordering. From a tomato bread executed with exquisite sensitivity, which is rare today, to an octopus as tender as a mermaid's kiss. Scallops are treated like queens. The list can go on. The service is friendly, patient, and efficient.\n",
      "Excellent food, very good attention. Super recommended\n",
      "With the pandemic they have cut back on the supply of dishes. But they‚Äôre all so good it doesn‚Äôt matter much.The supply of beers is huge. Homemade desserts ..A place where they do, they do it very well. And the personal attention is so good .... It's well worth going there. And now that we have to support local restaurants, more than ever!\n",
      "Small and charming place with a lot of imported beers. We had alberg√≠nia hummus and pork tenderloin. The dishes were rich, although the hummus was very small. Also noteworthy is the kindness of the service. We also had desserts, they were homemade and good.The menu was small and a bit repetitive, I suppose due to the difficulties of the current situation, so I encourage the residents of the area to approach the restaurant.\n",
      "If you go, ask that they not put too many chips on the plates. The tapas should be somewhat more abundant. But they are charming and the place is very nice.\n",
      "The sirloin melts in your mouth, austere tapas, I wonder why \"all\" the dishes to share and the seconds are accompanied by potato? Coincidence? Carbs rush ... Local and endearing staff.\n",
      "Hummus incredible, wonderful deal. The truth is that we were delighted, even on Saturday at noon with a very fast service! We will repeat surely\n",

      "A very familiar atmosphere with an excellent and select menu.I recommend it 100%\n",
      "The assortment of humus, impressive; the arepas, speechless; the sirloin, spectacular; the varied fish burgers, great and desserts ... the icing on the cake. All washed down with a variety of beers recommended by the owner, according to the taste of each diner. A taste of dinner!\n",
      "Very close treatment and quality / price more than acceptable.\n",
      "This restaurant, somewhat hidden, is a discovery. They have a very appetizing menu, with a very varied selection. All of very good quality, from the typical calamari tapa, the tartar stick, to the healthy, balanced and easy-to-eat \"children's dish\". The main courses looked very good. The relaxed atmosphere and the attentive staff, always with adequate suggestions. To stand out: the great variety of beers that they have. The very economical price and the good quality of products.

The careless service to be so small, we asked for some information about the cheeses that were being served, what kind of cheeses or something, but they only said that nothing special, that they were smoked and already, I expected more from this place but in the end I disappointed.\n",
      "Curious space of brave. Once you taste it, you return there because the place is very hot. The portions are in my opinion generous but they treat the product very well by adding author tags from someone who knows comvalacuiba.\n",

      "Passable. The friendly service. The quality beer, but the tapas are scarce and somewhat expensive. The worst, put chips in some fried eggs. The chips cannot be eaten well with a fork and with the juice of the egg they remain soft. Quite a mistake. The croquette is good, but extremely expensive, as is the assortment of hummus. The assortment of cheeses very good but, as usual, somewhat expensive. The truth, I do not understand how it is always full of diners. A good place to try, but there are many better places in Barcelona to eat.\n",

      "We went because we were looking for a place to eat cal√ßots without leaving Barcelona and we had seen on their website that they had cal√ßotada menu. They have enabled both the exterior patio and two interior rooms with views of the city. Now, in times of a pandemic, I would recommend either the patio or the small room. The cal√ßotada menu includes two tiles of cal√ßots, a second of meat, desserts, drinks and coffee, all for 35 euros. The quality is good, although it is missed that the cal√ßots are unlimited as in other menus. The homemade cake, very rich. I would recommend updating the menus on the web as the waitress told us that the information was not valid.\n",
      "The food is excellent and the service very friendly and correct. Right price-quality. It has impressive views of the city and it is a very quiet place. I recommend it.\n",
      "Simple but good food although very meager portions. The setting is fantastic, the waiters friendly and attentive even though they were quite crowded. The food is very simple, although the ingredients look good, but the portions are very scarce. Too bad, because the environment invites you to repeat but the quantity / price ratio has not been good.\n",
      "The menu is correct, the grill great, The environment is ideal for the views of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãstaff are very attentive and fast. Although the access is complicated and the price, a little above expectations ...\n",

      "I booked to make a cal√ßotada, when I arrived they gave me the menu and when I asked for the cal√ßots menu (35 ‚Ç¨) they told me there weren't any (although there were 12 boxes in front of the table of cal√ßots). I commented to him that at the time of booking I had already asked to make cal√ßots and then suddenly they already had them! When I ordered there were already dishes that they didn't have anymore and it wasn't so late ... The service was very busy, I don't blame them, the volume of people was powerful. Despite ordering between the remaining dishes they changed one of our orders because there was no left. The amount of cal√ßots is scarce, only one tile per person and they do not give orange between the cal√ßots and the grilled meat. I wanted to find a good and correct place near Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbut this is definitely not üòü\n",

      "Very bad treatment by the staff.They were complete.They also don't pick up the phone to make a reservation.We arrive at the restaurant, where it is not easy to get there, and they tell us in a very bad way that they are full, leaving me halfway, I tell them thatFewer should answer the calls, to which the one in the kitchen appears, lowering his mask and tells me that he had not come to the site, that it is not their problem and that if they do not answer the call it is because they are busy ...Well, very well, calm that I will not return, nor will I recommend this place.I hope your good streak lasts ... because with such attention ...\n",

      "Finding this site has been one of the best things that happened to us during our visit to Barcelona. The deal is very close, the suggestions on the nail, and a top product. We ate stuffed eggplants and grilled rabbit. For dessert cheesecake and cottage cheese with honey.\n",
      "Quite a success, attention, speed, kindness and delicious food and the bill, 160 and we were 4 adults and a child, do not change anything. As we are in the winter we were all inside and a bit of noise if there was any.\n",
      "Unique views. Good food and a good price.\n",
      "We removed this restaurant from our list. HORRIBLE SERVICE !! We called to make a reservation on the terrace and they told us that until the day before they did not make reservations. The day before, when trying to book right at the restaurant's opening time, they told us that they had already taken the terrace reservations in previous days and that, in addition, it was going to rain. Fatal, we are not even going to consider trying to go again ... And if you want to book, make sure they do not lie to you because you have many numbers to run out of a table (they are only for colleagues ...)\n",
      "Very bad treatment. They don't pick up the phone and if they do it is in very bad ways. I reserved a table and the day before when I call to confirm they tell me that they are not full. The food may already be very tasty, but I still would not go.\n",
      "CAN MART√ç ... WHAT T'EST√Ä PASSANT?What happens to you Can Mart√≠?Can Mart√≠ has ‚Äã‚Äãalways been a point of reference as a \"picnic area\", an easy and good restaurant within its simple menus that help you not to have to decide ...... I have been going back and forth regularly for 30 years at fantastic dinners for large groups, friends, intimate and even work ...... ALWAYS WELL without the need for change and with 5-star ratings for the freshness and kindness of the treatment ... a whole set of well-understood simplicities that made everything easy there ...BUT...... I came back a few weeks ago and was surprised that the menu options had been eliminated ... A point of surprise and sadness but that is assumed if the menu responds to the same spirit traditionally offered ...... basic food well done ...When ordering the truth is that we were a bit negatively surprised by the abundance of the portions of simple things.One of the dishes that we ordered was some bravas and the portion was more than scarce ... it reminded me in quantity of the volume of Tom√†s de Sarri√† but with the Can Mart√≠ formalization ...... if you want to compare with before and that portion was a third of the old portions ...I will return but I think it will lose the charisma that differentiated it and it is becoming ANOTHER RESTAURANT ......... nostalgia for recent times past ... a year ago it still hadn't changed and everything was as before ...\n",
      "Good views, good food and live music in the afternoon.\n",
      "A spectacular place ... between pine forests and views of Barcelona ... the first class service is worth going both in summer and in winter I have been in both times\n",

      "Very good grilled meat, family atmosphere and incredible views of Barcelona. Ideal for an outdoor outing in the city. We will repeat !!\n",
      "Price quality not recommended. Treatment by unfortunate and out of place owner. I recommend other restaurants\n",
      "I give them 4 stars because the service has been great, very friendly and attentive. Too bad small details (like too many cal√ßots, for my taste and a couple of things +) Pxo could have a 5 stars if these little details worked a little +\n",
      "The treatment was unbeatable, we arrived without reservation and a little late and had no problem sitting down. The food was very good. Everything we tasted we liked a lot.To put a stick is a bit badly signaled. The entrance sign does not look good.\n",
      "The last time we were there was a bit disastrous but the regents have changed and now it has improved a lot! Prices have risen, but there is much more service and friendlier.Recommendable!\n",
      "Typical Catalan cuisine. The food is good and the place is nice with good views. Access a bit complicated by the area and parking depends on the volume of people, it can be difficult due to the slope. The cal√ßots were very rich and the service was attentive.\n",
      "One of the best places I have stepped on in Barcelona. Good cal√ßots, tremendously good dishes, quality home cooking. And rumba, music and good vibes galore.\n",

      "Friendly, good quality food. We will be back, for sure.\n",
      "The worst romesco sauce I've ever tasted (very liquid and with very little or no nuts in the mix) ... Too bad it's worth the cal√ßots menu and the spectacular views of the poorly maintained place.The garnish of the dishes is very scarce.Very good staff attention.\n",

      "Good deal, good food. What more could you want?\n",
      "Fantastic cal√ßots and other dishes, too. The view of Barcelona from there, magnificent\n",
      "Perhaps the best place to make cal√ßots in Barcelona. Clambered over the waterway. It is a long climb and it costs to park. Great views. Very attentive service\n",
      "The entrecote was very good, the calcotes and the sauce very tight.\n",
      "We called on Thursday to reserve and they told us they were not booking outside because it was raining and they said to call on Saturday at 10. We called again on Friday seeing that the forecast changed and they repeated the same thing.And today we call at 10 and they tell us they're sorry but they already have everything booked.\n",
      "A quiet place, good food and good views of Barcelona.\n",

      "Great location\n",
      "Very good meats. Desserts and mojitos leave something to be desired\n",
      "An excellent place in the mountains. It costs a little to get there because you have to go by car yes or yes, but it is worth going. The views are spectacular, I don't know if there will be another restaurant in Barcelona with better views. A marvel. We ate menu cal√ßots, ‚Ç¨ 35 per person, just perfect (nothing expensive for the place and quality). The cal√ßots well made and rich sauce, then entrec√¥te de sec (there are several things to choose from) very tasty. It comes with accompaniment and bread with tomato. The dessert is homemade and is enjoyed a lot after the harton of previous food. The cheese cake ... I would go back almost alone for that cake. 100% recommended the place. Excellent. You have to ask for a reservation in advance because it is full. However, the atmosphere is very good, you don't feel like there are many people. As points to improve: the wine justea a little and the air conditioning too. Still great experience that exceeded our expectations by far. Gem in the mountain.\n",
      "The fatal food, we have ordered cal√ßots and they were totally charred. They serve grilled Carme super fast because they already have it prepared and it is cold. Saturated and they do not give vast because it is the only one there is. But I have to admit that the attention of the staff was great. Felipe has attended us and has been super attentive.\n",
      "Well\n",
      "A restaurant where you eat very well, environment and very pleasant staff. We will repeat\n",
      "I treat 10 diners and view the spectacular coastline, the food is better not to comment because I am short\n",

      "Precious and delicious one of the best places to see Barcelona from above while you eat.\n",
      "A good place to go to eat! The attention is very correct, they are efficient and friendly. Food with a value for money. The space is very clean but quite sloppy. Cheers!\n",
      "Spectacular\n",
      "A 10 for this restaurant. You eat luxury in a natural environment. Pleasant treatment and quality price very good.\n",

      "The cal√ßots are very good.\n",
      "To eat calsots is without a doubt theBest place. The panoramic view of Barcelona is priceless and the excellent service. Don't pretend luxury if everything else.\n",
      "I called to reserve several times, as they did not pick up the phone we decided to stop by. They were full, and they told me that I should call ahead to reserve.Today I have called again 3 times in their schedule, they hang up on me, it's not that they don't pick it up .... they hang up.Apparently they have plenty of customers.\n",
      "Great place to eat and great views on your deck. I tried their grilled meat and it is great and the people who served us very friendly. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Meat restaurant, located very close to the Sagrada Familia.I will divide the review into four sections:- Space: Original decoration and pleasant atmosphere. Wide and well separated tables. They have meat refrigerators in plain sight where you can see the different pieces of meat they offer.- Food: Excellent. Very good raw material with impeccable workmanship. Amazing desserts.- Service: Impeccable. We arrived late at the last noon shift in full restrictions for the covid, and yet they were very kind, taking the time to explain the different dishes, and making very good recommendations. Really nice.- Price: Good value for money. It‚Äôs not cheap, but the quality pays off, it‚Äôs worth every penny it costs.- Bonus: It‚Äôs really hard to find such round restaurants in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthis has made it one of our favorite restaurants. Congratulations on a job well done.\n",
      "Good quality, price well fair quantity. But all very good\n",
      "Very good food, but the portions a little small, I really liked the variety and quality of the product but with a little more meat in the portions would be excellent, we will have a great time again.\n",
      "Excellent place, I am celiac and they have adapted the menu, I will return because I felt very comfortable and attended. The waiters explain the dishes and assure you that they are gluten-free, they separate the dishes if necessary without you telling them, it is the first time I have seen it, it means that they are informed and that they serve consciously, thank you!\n",
      "Great place to go with a group or a couple, try many dishes to share a good meat and finish with their incredible desserts.I quite liked the place, very well set on the theme of meat.The \"must\" to order: Fricand√≥ Sandwich, Mollet Eggs with octopus and parmentier, Thousand artichoke leaves, foie gras and truffle. Xoco-pistachio and Torrija.\n",
      "Decorated in an authentic, comfortable, cozy and ecological way, using recycled elements to form a very special set.Quality and elaboration of the products üëåüèªPolite and pleasant staff.Specialty: meatsMedium / high price fully justified.‚Ç¨ 40 approx per head.We will be back! :) Thank you\n",
      "Perfect! Dani is a very close person, few cooks serve you at the table and recommend which is the best choice to enjoy the experience.‚Ç¨ 40 per person is a correct price for what your palate enjoys. Everything was spectacular, but I'll stick with the ribs, it made my mouth water!\n",
      "We went for lunch and really had other expectations, but still, it was a very good experience. In my opinion the idea is of a restaurant with a fast service, like a menu, to try to say so that it is understood, but elevated to a level of dish restaurant.Being a meat-based restaurant, the cooking point, where the dishes are served is perfect, and the quality of the meat is simply excellent.In the menu you will find very little diversity but quite right, and the desserts, both the torrija and the envelopes are brutal.The service despite being very good, always, in my opinion, you notice some take from a restaurant menu of 12 ‚Ç¨ to put it in some way, and on the wall there is a phrase that has called me quite 'attention, which is to say that there is no table service, and therefore there are no liquors or drinks to do on table, which further reinforces this feeling.As things that can be improved, I find that the level of drinks, except beer and wines, does not correspond to the level of food. The water is served in a plastic bottle and at least the coke is canned, in my case I prefer to pay a little more and have glass water and soft drinks in a glass bottle.In terms of price, the surprise has been very positive as having ordered, stektartar, tacos, spectacular and different from the \"normal\", nebraska entrecotte, brutal, or rib made at low temperature, dessert and coffee, has been 85 ‚Ç¨ but 2 people, which I think is more than correct always taking into account the quality of the product and the quantities.I will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu\n",
      "Veamooooooss. Can you imagine finding a ‚Ç¨ 500 bill in your pocket?Exceptional food, perfect attention, pleasant local and Dani, a chef who has managed to redirect his talent and efforts to offer the maximum expression of enjoying meat.You should not make a monument to the \"denito\", no ... it should be a world heritage site.Just by going back there, we will go through our beloved but rebellious and uncomfortable Barcelona again. Just to go to BARDENI.\n",
      "Restaurant specializing in meats. Highly recommended and great attention. Price per person with wine and dessert about 40-50 ‚Ç¨.\n",
      "Treatment and top quality.Family atmosphere, few tables and good recommendations. They have fixed dishes and recommendations of the day, with seasonal dishes.The wine list is very complete and with very reasonable prices.One of the best in the area for excellent eating at a very reasonable price.\n",
      "Be careful, the chef is crazy or was on his worst day. The food is impeccable, really the best meats of my life, but it was leaving the restaurant and on the sidewalk of the place, we saw a newspaper clipping that says that the chef Dani Lechuga is one of the best ... my partner and I do the joke that is ironic (without him in front of it) that calling himself Lettuce cooks the best meats. Then he opened a door and came out to face us, with an aggressive attitude and wanting to fight demanding respect, after apologizing, explaining to him that it was a comment and that his food had blown us away and his last name and his profession were very ironic behind a restaurant in cards, not low intensity and if it is not because we are quiet people that could have ended in much more ...Without knowing him, I would have put 5 stars, I would have returned, and I would have recommended him to all my important colleagues in the music industry, but with that emotional intelligence to deal with clients, I think it better not to return the truth.\n",
      "If you like meat this is your place. The place has its charm, the first time I went I was surprised, the staff very friendly and the kitchen a scandal.The taco mex, the steak tartar, the brutal fricand√≥ sandwich, the spectacular tuna tataki, and x mi the tiramisu of the best I've tried, I always fall short, a little more than I would appreciate. Hoping to be able to return soon.\n",
      "A meat restaurant, with a good diversity of dishes and a good product, but: they don‚Äôt book and they don‚Äôt seat you until all the beginnings are there, there are no digestives and they don‚Äôt let you make dessert. The place is very simple.\n",
      "All very well. All. The service, the place and the food. It is one of the restaurants in Barcelona that you have to go from time to time.\n",
      "Classy food, super quality ingredients, stylish preparation. Serve super! To visit!\n",
      "Always delighted !!!! Always!!! This is a sure hit, and it is said by someone who is not completely carnivorous ... but the truth is that every once in a while it tastes good. The steak tartar, as always, incredible. In fact, we chose the restaurant because we wanted to eat a good tartar. Seasonal artichokes with very good foie gras. The cheek, also perfect. Sorry, I prefer to get tired and not leave room for dessert;)\n",
      "All exquisite, nice treatment, something expensive in relation to the quantities.\n",
      "I went to lunch.Meat is handled Angus beef, French beef, and chooses the French meat of the aged meat. It was a dish with umami that had been condensed.Every dish is delicious and one of the shops I would like to visit again.There was also a Japanese menu.\n",
      "A very nice place to eat, with very correct attention and some exquisite dishes! Everything is beautiful and without frills. The dessert torrija is brutal !!\n",
      "We were on a Tuesday for dinner. Everything was exquisite, they had seasonal truffle dishes and we took advantage. All great and good service\n",
      "The most brutal meat of Bcn. To highlight the steak tartare\n",
      "Spectacular! Excellent product, exquisite treatment and pleasant atmosphere! The meat to the point, the cola beef cola a delight and the selection of cheese, you have the best way to finish the dinner.A 10 in every way, especially for the company.\n",
      "Exquisite restaurant to taste different meat dishes.High quality product and elaborate elaborations.Great cuisine and service, if you like meat it is a must.Do not miss the oxtail cannelloni, the ‚Äúfricand√≥‚Äù and its meats.\n",
      "We have loved the place! Super friendly and exceptional food\n",
      "If Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthen this restaurant !! For all meat lovers, every dish is a culinary delight. It was all a taste explosion .. I never thought that pulpo would fit so well with egg ...I'm not really a Tartar fan but this beef tartare was so well prepared and so good .. this restaurant will definitely be back on the next trip üôåüèº\n",
      "The meat dishes were really good! Four minutes away from the Sagrada Familia, it's perfect for lunch! The wine was also Spanish and delicious! I ate risotto and it was very delicious and I could understand the sweetness of the shrimp!\n",
      "Spectacular. The Denito surprises you from the first moment. I don't think I can eat meat again without comparing it to rl I tried here. The quality and balance left us drunk on food. Recommended no, the following for meat lovers, especially for those who like raw steak: this is another level (at least the Tab and veal amn coffee paris, being the first especially tasty)\n",
      "If you like meat, it is the perfect place to go, a high quality product cooked with criteria and knowledge.\n",
      "Very good proposal in the neighborhood. If you like meat, you have to go, but if you don't like meat, you also have to stop by. For me, it is a special occasions site. Good service and a good gastronomic proposal. The price a little high, but at the height of what they offer.\n",
      "Behind the red door there is magic. I just can't believe I thought I was going to a bar for a glass of wine and zaz! I left there with the joy of having a warm and delicious dinner. The photos speak for themselves but I have to say that the chef's suggestions were so right that they should be on the menu forever. Putting aside the super cool of the place (which has a weight at the entrance and that the menus are written on the walls) the attention was exceptional and I will definitely return. Please order the cannelloni, the foie strudel, the tartare and everything they recommend lol delicious.\n",
      "A very cozy place, very good care and a selection of delicious meats with very good treatment. There are also croquettes, octopus with potato cream and egg, half-cooked, salad ... Attention to the dishes off the menu. They recommend two dishes per person but you may be a ‚Äútragoncete‚Äù and order some more. Steak, tab, beef ribs, taco-mex, meatballs ... White tiles on the wall, letter written in black, dishes of the day in red. The bill? depending on the dishes you eat, count from ‚Ç¨ 40. Location: next to the Sagrada Familia. A curiosity: the decoration of dragon ball in the toilet.\n",
      "Excellent !! Great restaurant !!! Without flourishes, they go straight to the product !!! All the dishes very well thought out, cooked to perfection. Highlight the gutter, s√°ndwich fricand√≥ and the roasted rib! La Torrija is in my top 3\n",
      "I was really surprised by the octopus eggs and the very tasty Tablet\n",
      "The best meat. Careful dishes, very good taste and careful presentation\n",
      "Delicious dishes ... with respect to the quality of the good products served ... intensity of flavor in each bite.The egg with octopus and parmentier ... delicious! And the rice with porcini and red shrimp off the menu ... sublime! Perhaps what I liked least were the meatloaf.The price is \"high\" but it is justified by the flavor and intensity of the dishes that require a lot of work and good raw materials.\n",
      "Small place with quick service and exquisite dishes. Specialized in meats. Highly recommended It does not admit reservations.\n",
      "Very cool site. I'm not much into raw meat but the sirloin is great!\n",
      "Spectacular food where there is brutal experience the treatment of the local staff and especially the food, I ENJOY !! If you like meat and eat well I recommend this small place in Valencia street Barcelona where the culinary experience is spectacular, I loved it and I will definitely go back, very highly recommended.\n",
      "It's not the first time that I eat dani lettuce's meat bar and as always it surprises me.This time I asked myself:1- Steak tartare the best I've ever had with its spicy touch. (They prepare it to taste).2- Foie mi cuit excellent caramelized on top and its apple compote.3- Octopus with its parmentier4- Millefeuille of foie with leek (Season dish)5- Torrijas and Catalan cream foam a 10Another thing that never ceases to amaze me are its seasonal dishes.Recommendation to order all dishes to share.EXCELLENT üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•\n",
      "Fantastic place to enjoy top quality and well-treated meat. Good wine carya and nice and fun atmosphere.\n",
      "Of the best dinners I've had in Barcelona. I could cut the entrec√¥te with the fork. The tartare, the egg with octopus, the sardines, the croquettes ... all great. You have to assume the rules they have so that they do not affect the experience: the whole group must arrive to be given a table, they do not make reservations, they must make the whole meal order at once, they do not sell liquors or spirits .\n",
      "A cozy and informal place to go as a couple or with the family. Surprising gastronomic range by chef Dani Lechuga. This meatbar focuses on meat as the central axis of its kitchen. I was able to try many of the dishes which are well presented and come in comfortable portions for the palate. One of the best entrecots I have ever eaten has been at this place. Spectacular offer of flavors, textures and unique meat in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand yes or yes, you should come to taste.\n",
      "If you like meat, try it. A totally informal restaurant, which serves without reservation and with very good products and meat work. The cannelloni, the croquettes, the artichokes with foie, the egg with octopus ... A success.\n",
      "Many rules for a restaurant that does not surprise in its dishes either. Correct food and very good meat (which for the price can be already) It is not a restaurant that would have an impact.\n",
      "Pleasant surprise, very good all 100% recommended, at noon there is no line!\n",
      "Different and special place. All great. The best steak tartar ever, entrecot premium, ribs. Close and friendly treatment. Or you arrive before opening or you risk to put yourself on the waiting list and they call you when there are free tables ... (like me). It's worth a lot!\n",
      "A cozy restaurant where you can enjoy possibly the best food in Barcelona. It is about portions to share. Everything I've tried is spectacular. The price is around ‚Ç¨ 25-30 per person, but it is worth a try.\n",
      "Restaurant in the Sagrada Familia neighborhood, if you like good meat you can not stop going, perfect service with good advice when choosing, they do not reserve a table but that is not a problem, well here are some photos\n",
      "One of my reference restaurants in Barcelona to eat meat. Really spectacular the ‚Äúfricand√≥‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlack angus de nebraska‚Äù, ‚ÄúCostillar‚Äù and outside of the carnivorous dishes the ‚ÄúRisotto de ceps‚Äù seems exceptional to me, BUT the rules of not being able to sit unless the full table is regular customers) detracts from service and a lack of detail on the part of the management ... At 15:00 the kitchen closes and you cannot book, it makes it very difficult to go regularly. It's a shame, sometimes some flexibility makes you win customers, I imagine they don't need them ...\n",
      "Small shop in the right Eixample.They have a menu that although not very extensive offers a selection of high quality dishes. They have very very good meat, including the onglet, the steak tartar or the filet. There are also good desserts and suggestions that change, and the staff is very friendly.A point to note is that they do not reserve tables and it is usually quite full, so it is best to go either without haste or early.\n",
      "Very good place to have delicious dishes, full flavor cuisine!\n",
      "A word: BRUTAL!\n",
      "The site is small and they do not reserve, so it is advisable to arrive early.The service is impeccable, to the point of separating the portions to share even in different dishes.The excellent food. Essential for the oxtail cannelloni and highly recommended steak tartare or any of the hamburgers, all great.It is not a cheap site, but the quality of the raw material is well worth it.\n",
      "Amazing. Perfect service and food\n",
      "One of the best sirloins I have ever tasted, with the txuleta we had no luck, we got a piece with a lot of fat and fibers\n",
      "Successful formula based on going to work to enjoy the best beef and other dishes.\n",
      "A tad expensive, without adjusting they would embroider it\n",
      "An unforgettable experience! The place is a jewel in this area, a very cozy atmosphere and it is worth the wait. The treatment of the unbeatable staff, very solicitous and attentive - unlike other sites with the same level. It seems to me that the people there are really happy to serve good food and make one come out wanting to come back and share their experience. I recommend the suckling pig that has a crunchy layer and the onglet (that melts in the mouth, very rich!). The wine list is also super fine.\n",
      "Nice, comfortable and informal place. Attentive and professional service. Excellent raw materials treated with respect and love. It is recommended to blindly surrender to the suggestions of the head of the room. Difficult to highlight one dish over the others since everything was delicious, artichokes, pine nuts and foie gras, rice with porcini and prawns, cannelloni with oxtail, meatballs, romesco and shrimp, entrecote, ... And desserts mmmm ... We all loved the Catalan cream, French toast, sorbets and tiramisu. We will definitely return.\n",
      "We were here for lunch and were served excellently. The food was in outstanding quality. I highly recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "This restaurant pleasantly surprised us! We have loved all the dishes, but I have to stand out as the best Los Tacos and El Denito ... impressive! We will be back soon!\n",
      "The best way I know to enjoy meat\n",
      "We will definitely repeat !!! We are delighted, the starters starters and the meat melts in the mouth. Pure delight and with affordable prices 25/30 euros üíµ per head.\n",
      "The food is very good and the service is right, but the rules you receive before entering personally seem exaggerated and do not match the restaurant.\n",
      "What good meat! A great find! I will be back many times for \"El Denito\" sandwich. Incredible everything- quality of raw material, preparation and service. Has it all.\n",
      "I wanted to go there for a long time, it is certainly a different place with personality. The quality of the food is spectacular and each dish is a journey through the senses. All in addition to great customer service. Congratulations to the entire Cal Deni team for a job well done.\n",
      "100% recommended. We have been very august. Very nice place and perfect treatment and delicious food !!\n",
      "8/10. A little gem in an area full of gastronomic offer for tourists. The dishes are fair in size, but the quality of the products solves that detail. Good wine list. Go straight to the meat dishes, because a good tomato is available, but not meats cooked this rich. The jerky is 10. The foie is combined with macerated fruit and a crispy layer, 10 tmb. And the 24hr cooked Angus rib was amazing! Don't book and there are few tables, go early!\n",
      "Excellent restaurant. It offers a not too extensive menu but all the proven dishes, 6, of exceptional quality and preparation. Very correct service and adjusted prices ... you pay what you taste.\n",
      "I can only say .. delicious. About 45e per person\n",
      "All the dishes are spectacular. One of the best meats I have ever tasted. I will repeat.\n",
      "Great variety of meat, everything tasted great.\n",
      "This octopus foie gras is deliciously crazy\n",
      "Quality food, perfect meat and in its point, very elaborate dishes, even to share. The price is not bad.\n",
      "One of my favorite restaurants in the city of Barcelona.Incredible how they work the meat and present it in surprising dishes: fricando sandwich, ribs, tacos ...The big drawback is the little flexibility they offer to regular customers: they don't make reservations; if you arrive at 15:05, you can no longer sit; If all the diners are not there, neither is it. It is very good to have rules, but to believe something that you are not, is a problem and causes you to lose many customers. Unfortunately, we have not returned ...\n",
      "It was great, super quiet, a pleasant waiter and delicious food. Ideal for a couple.\n",
      "Everything is fantastic, but in 45 minutes everything is served. Too fast to taste such delicious delicacies.\n",
      "A good place to have a vermouth with an aperitif, and with a menu with a variety of good quality dishes.The atmosphere is a Catalan winery with touches updated at the moment.Highlight the tables of cheeses, sausages, as well as the variety of wines they offer.The service was very attentive and fast.We will return without a doubt!\n",
      "We have recently been in the neighborhood and it is difficult to find a good place to have a vermouth. And this is the site!They have tables inside and outside, we decided to wait until we could sit on the terrace. The waiter who took great care of us. We have missed several dishes, so we will have to go back !!\n",
      "We have been going to this place for a long time, since it was opened and lately we have turned around several times since it is full or they sneak in to take a table: / I think it is something that they would have to manage better especially because we love to eat and drink at the Collonut. The menu is between traditional and original. We usually order the terrines that are served with plenty of bread so you don't fall short, the potato omelette, the truffled bikini, the croquettes, etc. It is a great place to have a vermouth and it's worth the wait.\n",
      "Good food and good service. It would be more a 4.5 out of 5. Very pleasant staff treatment and good quality / price ratio. Recommended your visit\n",
      "Everything correct, tasty food, wine list is not bad, they also have international wines, very friendly and fast staff. They have tables outside as well.\n",
      "A half hour sitting at the table waiting to be ordered at least for drinks and there has been no way, even calling the waiter several times. We had to leave because they passed without raising their heads. You can understand that they are overwhelmed, but not show indifference or disdain.Serve this as a touch of attention to the owners, the service should be reinforced at the weekend and try to encourage the staff to perform their functions more comfortably.\n",
      "Spectacular neighborhood vermuteria. Good prices and very good quality. To repeat. The photo shows the quality .....\n",
      "Perfect for a tapas and a beer, to highlight the home style in the food and the atmosphere and decoration, which are very successful. If you are looking for the typical cheap Chinese bar Pepe this is not your place. It is not expensive but not cheap either. It consists of wooden stools and barrels, a small terrace on the street, and a bench outside to sit on. I recommend it if you are in the Plaza Maragall area and want to have something with a premium quality.\n",
      "A well-known and very attentive place in the heart of Sant Andreu and in Camp del Arpa where you can taste vermouth and very interesting tapas.I have been many times because of proximity and because I like it a lot, but the last two times the vermouth seemed watery and even slightly bad taste and I am afraid that they have changed the supplier and it is no longer the same.Likewise, their tapas are incredible, especially their smoked sardines that I love, their croquettes and their tortillas.I'll be back for the tapas, but I'll think about the vermouth üòìüìçSant Andreu and Camp del Arpaüí∞ ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨üõéÔ∏èDon't stop asking about dishes off the menu.\n",
      "We liked everything. Lots of variety of tapas and dishes. Good attention. The prices are correct.\n",
      "The food is very good, especially the potato omelette and the bacon with honey. The excellent treatment.\n",
      "My favorite place in Barcelona !! Whenever I can I go and although it is full it is worth waiting for the quality of the service and of course the food! I recommend it without any doubt!\n",
      "I met this bar yesterday. The terrace with its barrels as tables is great. It was Monday 22.20 when we arrived for a quick wine and a bite to eat. Few people and they took a long time to ask what, we wanted .... Luckily they did not have what we wanted ... If we had not even eaten it we would have asked right away they began to collect.We will try another day.\n",
      "Elaborate and innovative covers. There is a ‚Äúflag‚Äù with quail egg that is spectacular! It is worth approaching to enjoy and surprise yourself with some good tapas.\n",
      "Set in a traditional tavern, they delight you with exquisite tapas and you can accompany them with a wide variety of wines and beers. You have to go early as it fills up fast, but you always have the option of having a drink while you wait for a table either at the window bar or in the cushion area at the entrance. Perfect place to eat and have a drink and spend the afternoon. I need to go to Sant Andreu !!!\n",
      "Quality products, good homemade vermouth and well-drawn beers. The Collonut is always a success\n",
      "The place is fine, the waiter inside very friendly. The guy outside the terrace, a disaster ... Half an hour to bring you a beer and bring it to you doing you a favor. A shame since the place is good, food is good and the waiter inside the premises has always treated us perfectly.\n",
      "Fantastic place, kitchen, drinks, prices, all x a 4.5 but ... the bathrooms are a shame, and all in all, it's worth it k fix the toilets give bad image\n",
      "Rich vermot and very good value for money.\n",
      "Great place, excellent food, attentive service and reasonable price. To repeat\n",
      "Nice terrace.Good place to make a vermouth and chop something.Good service and right prices.\n",
      "Very nice neighborhood place. A shame the treatment that the guy in charge of the terrace has given us after queuing for a table on the terrace, he did not want to give it to us although he was free to leave it to other clients in the queue who have arrived later than us. I find it ugly that they don't respect the queue shift and have preferential treatment.\n",
      "Incredible place to have a drink and a snack, the table of Catalan sausages and the table of cheese are to die for, although it has many more options to choose from that are very good, very good quality products, at a price that did not seem scandalous to me. The attention received was very good and friendly.\n",
      "Very good quality. Good service and good atmosphere. Menu and dishes xl lunch or vermouth.\n",
      "Good place to have something or make some tapas at a very good price, the worst thing is that it is always very full and sometimes the service could be a little better\n",
      "PERFECT! Very good quality and good price. The waiters are a charm, a 10. The sobrasada was great, and their \"bravas\" potatoes are different but also very good, we recommend trying them, they are like a crunchy snak with sauce.Spectacular light bulbs and croquettes.I asked for advice on the beers and a 10, they got it right.Cozy local.It is well worth going.\n",
      "Everything is great! Totally recommendable!\n",
      "I have come three times and overall good, but much improved\n",
      "Small and interesting bar where to make a vermouth or have dinner there.They have a selection of spectacular tapas, with a raw material of first quality and an excellent elaboration.In addition, they have a large selection of wines and they will advise you based on your tastes.The service very friendly at all times, always willing to offer you what you need.As I have already said, a magnificent product with an excellent elaboration.Very good value for money.Without a doubt, a place to visit whenever possible.\n",
      "Great tapas, ideal for a vermouth with a traditional atmosphere. Perhaps the only downside is that on the days when the service is busiest, the service is not enough.\n",
      "Son Collonuts! Good food and drink. Everything from our house. Cheese tables, Catalan or Iberian sausages and an extensive menu to make vermouth almost a meal.\n",
      "Good price, good service, had a good time. I recommend it\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "Nice atmosphere with tasty tapas. Nice servants.\n",
      "Highly recommended for snacking. A \"collonut\" service.\n",
      "A great find! Last night we wanted to repeat and saw that Google appeared open. Surprise to arrive and see that they were closed for holidays üò• we will be back soon!\n",
      "Very good collonut bravas.Vermouth too.Recommendable.Covid OK measurements\n",
      "Excellent tapas üòãüòã good and fast service\n",
      "This Saturday we had three couples for dinner. We had tapas and everything, without exception, was delicious. I would highlight the oxtail. The treatment is more than good and the price is more than reasonable.\n",
      "It never fails, very tasty tapas and affordable prices. Indispensable.\n",
      "Very good place and with variety of wines and tapas! The only downside though is that you have to wait a long time for a table, but it‚Äôs worth it!\n",
      "Very loose dishes, genre of very low quality. Badly washed beer glasses. Disaster\n",
      "The place well, attention very well and price wellThe music a little loud for a chat\n",
      "Very well drawn beer and friendly service. Next time we will try some tapas that looked very good.\n",
      "Ideal place to have a beer and something to eat, good atmosphere\n",
      "Everything was fine but I did not quite love it. There was something that had not just married in the flavors of the dishes. What I liked most was the wild boar terrine but the mango sauce was left over. Good value for money.\n",
      "You eat very well. Generous and quality tapas and portions. I don't give it 5 stars for the cleanliness of the sink. Honestly, it is a very important point to improve because it was disgusting to enter.\n",
      "Some totally different and delicious bravas, all tapas but very good and quality service.\n",
      "We have come several times but today we have been waiting for a table for 40 minutes, we have chosen that ... But when we finally sat down, the waiters lowered their heads and more than 20 minutes without even getting a drink ...\n",
      "Newly discovered site and certainly to repeat. We went on a weekday (Friday) at noon and it wasn't crowded, although there aren't many tables available inside. On the weekend it must be difficult to find a place at rush hour. They took good care of us (recommending various dishes) and we ate wonderfully. Extensive menu of tapas, plates and tables of sausages and cheeses. Many remain to be tested. Recommended 100‚ÑÖ.\n",
      "Excellent value for money. Their patatas bravas have their own style, something to value rather than criticize since their flavor and crunchy texture is spectacular, not to mention the very good sauces. Another thing, the vermouth is delicious and the decoration served is very beautiful. I repeat without a doubt.\n",
      "Great place to have a drink with friends, partner, etc. The waiters a 10 and both locals 10üëåüèΩ\n",
      "Very good service and different tapas prepared with great taste\n",
      "Nice, good treatment and very good all the tapas we ate.\n",
      "Excellent discovery in the neighborhood, good quality products. Very good attentions.\n",
      "I love this site! Good atmosphere, friendly staff and simple but delicious food! I always ask for a plate of Catalan cheeses or sausages and some croquettes !! They are irresistibleüòã The last time I tried the truffled bikinis and my palate exploded! You will not be disappointed by this site\n",
      "It's been a long time since I've found a place in Barcelona with such an attentive service, and everyone speaks Catalan, I don't remember when.Very good Collonut.\n",
      "First time I went and last, very bad attention by the waiters, after being more than 30 'waiting for a table they finally give us a table and another 30' waiting to take our order and not even the drink, finally we got up and left without dinner, embarrassing !!!\n",

      "We arrived at 10:15 pm (it said that they closed at 00:00) on the terrace they did not let us because they closed at 23 (but they were already picking up and closing tables) and they told us that inside but we had to ask NOW.We ordered the calamari (no more), the two toasts: sardine and panxeta (the panxeta very good but quite oily) and the 3 cheese board ..... except for the comt√©, the others only tasted like butter. The peaks a bit old ... I don't see the direct jam on the table much, but hey. The jam very good.I did not like that all the sausages were on the bar aerated right there with the times ...I treat without more, little welcoming. Maybe it was a Monday, I don't know.\n",

      "The oxtail is brutal !!\n",
      "Nice place to do the vermouth. The place is big, at least compared to this type of \"wineries / bars\" The correct service and above all very fast. The letter is pretty good although you miss some typical tapa. We ordered the patatas bravas with √±ora that were not bad but they did not kill, croquettes of suckling pig and apple that seemed delicious, the elaboration was good but they lacked flavor and some banderillas of egg of quail, cecina with fresh cheese and olive. The sausages looked very good and there is a lot of variety of drinks. I'll come back to try something else more that I'm left with ...\n",

They have artisanal and some imported beers.The food is very good quality.I recommend, for price / quantity, to take the liter bottle beer bottle, which is either Turia (Valencian beer) or In√®dit (the Damm of Ferran Adri√†).It is better to go there not too late as it is usually filled quite fast.Totally recommended.\n",
      "The bravas could be improved. But the croquettes were awesome. Good range of wines and vermouth.\n",

      "Inattentive service and tasty food\n",
      "Very good croquettes\n",
      "I share my impression of a single first visit. The place is small and limited capacity. The ambience and pleasant staff, atmosphere of gourmet bodeguilla charcuterie !. Most tables are with barrel and high stool. The assortment of tapas is limited and I decided on some acorn ham croquettes and some pumps. When tasting the croquettes, the first thing that is appreciated is a good crunchy batter and not very oily. After a soft and mellow mass is responsible for the second round. Too bad that here, in the mass we take the first disappointment to find it soseta, without flavor and of course ham or acorn photo. Perfect texture but very loose flavor. The pumps come in second place. Practically the same experience is repeated. Good on the outside, normal inside, maybe a little better than croquettes. At the moment everything a bit sosete, I ask the refinitiva for the jump-off, squid to the Andalusian, luck is cast! Good looking, but when tasting them ..., you realize that a squid frozen by very good batter that has in it stays. The \"ali i oli negro\" with which it is served is striking, which calls more for its color than for its flavor, where we are in the same tonic as before, flat, without prompting to wet anything in it. The experience has not been bad, but with a nuance of hospital food that I did not expect from this place. It is a first impression of a first visit. In my opinion the food is served in small portions and is not up to the price it has. I will give you a second chance to rate more variety of your offer. Kiss\n",
      "All great, the only bad thing is that it is difficult to decide what to choose.\n",

It is ideal on the terrace, since there are fabulous views and it is covered and airy, which is appreciated because the pleasant breeze circulates. I do not put 5 stars because when we arrived, which was still empty of customers, they located us correctly but the fault is that the following customers put them next to our table, having plenty of space to be more distanced and more in covid time.\n",

      "Spectacular tasting menu, two hours of pleasure. Everything melts in your mouth, even the squid. They only accept 15 diners throughout the venue. Bar service, ample space for each diner. To repeat without hesitation.\n",
      "If you are looking for Japanese flavor, experience and atmosphere ... this is THE place. Incredible personal attention from the chef in the preparation of each dish; It is a kind of menu that they serve step by step, where each one is made in an artisanal way that only the Japanese have. The fresh, top-quality ingredients that make the menu cost worthwhile. That if ... do not forget to make a reservation early because it is always full!\n",
      "Simply spectacular: the food, the attention, the service ... A 10 in everything. Excellent value for money and an experience to recommend and repeat.\n",
      "Spectacular. Out of 10 everything: the quality of the ingredients, the combinations and sas√≥n, the attention. Really, once you eat at Sato i Tanaka, the rest of the sushi in Barcelona is too small for you. Arigato.\n",
      "We went for dinner at this Japanese restaurant located on calle bruc in Barcelona. You can choose √† la carte dishes but the most recommended is the tasting menu. Concept of traditional Japanese tavern and sushis served with great care. 13 niguiris that raise the level as the night goes on. My favorites were the viera and red shrimp (spectacular). We are going to talk about the place, an ideal place to eat as a couple or with a group of friends since they are bars where in the center you have a cook at your disposal serving you sushi at the moment. Regarding food, the tasting menu consists of a starter, 13 niguiris, a miso mussels soup and desserts. The same at first glance it seems little but you are completely satisfied. I recommend booking well in advance as there is a waiting list.\n",
      "Two menus one long and the other short. We ordered the long ... all sushi üç£ assorted, a starter, and miso soup .... Very good quality. The itamae prepares everything before us. The place is small only 15 people. Not cheap but i think it is worth ...\n",
      "Quite a show! The pampering behind the bar and the quality product take you to a dimension of sushi that was unknown.\n",
      "This restaurant consists of 2 bars (there are no tables) where you sit in front of the cook and watch the entire preparation process.The quality of the sushi is spectacular, the mid-day menu is well worth ordering. It consists of: an aperitif, 12nigiris, some makis, miso soup and a dessert (the best, the chocolate truffles and green tea). The truth is, you are quite full of quantity.Highly recommended!\n",
      "We finally got to go! A place that had been on the list for a long time and had always been difficult for me because you have to book well in advance. I had the table for a month or so and IT WAS WORTH IT.We have ordered the long menu. The restaurant has no tables, only two bars. So it is small, cozy and you see how your dishes are prepared. Except for the dessert and the miso soup, everything has been different types of sushi. It is difficult to make a ranking because the quality of the product was very good and well prepared, but I think at the beginning I would say one of cuttlefish with lime, that of sea urchins and one of tuna (from the fatter part).Watching the dishes prepare was like watching a very elegant dance.\n",
      "Simply and simply SPECTACULAR. Really the best Japanese restaurant in Barcelona.The quality of the product added to the care and professionalism of the cooks, especially mr. Tanaka.Thank you for having a restaurant with such a top atmosphere and food!\n",
      "Everything was super rich and pleasant except the sea urchin sushi. It tasted not very fresh and there was a little sand inside.\n",
      "AMAZING JAPANESE. One of the best Japanese restaurants I've ever had. All exquisite and the quality of the product is very good. The niguiris are exceptional and the miso soup incredible.You also eat at the bar and see first-hand how the niguiris are made.\n",
      "Very good service and a quality product. It's a spectacle to see how the sushi-man is preparing the nigiris. The menu is sushi in all its versions. The newspaper menu is very competitively priced. It is essential to book.\n",
      "Brutal.The ones I liked the most were the eel and bonito nigiri.The second best: shrimp nigiri, tuna, scallop, and sea bream.It is expensive but worth it.\n",
      "SPECTACULAR!!! I do not see the time to return. A raw material of great quality, incredible fish. All prepared with much care in front of you. The way to cut the fish is practically hypnotic. The best Japanese I have tasted so far. The menu is simple but there is a variety of fish. Desserts not usual in other restaurants. Despite being at the bar it is very comfortable and since there are not many people the atmosphere is very calm and intimate. The place is small but in this case it is appreciated, it makes the service even more exclusive. The price was a pleasant surprise since it is not expensive for what they offer. Attentive and detailed service. It has to be booked well in advance but it's worth it. I have already said that I want to go back ??\n",
      "Sato y Tanaka is synonymous with quality and good work. A high quality product coupled with impeccable service. Seeing both Sato and Tanaka work the product is pure melody.It is without a doubt among the best Japanese restaurants in Barcelona.\n",
      "I called a thousand times. They didn't answer me. The waitress was too busy. You got freaked out ..\n",
      "Price-quality is very good. Fresh and well prepared product.\n",
      "I've been to Japan a couple of times and I've tried to try the ones I read that are the Japanese restaurants in Barcelona (with what the economy allows me) such as Koy Shunka, Shunka, Wakasa or Yashima. I have to say that some of the nigiris I tried here are some of the best I have ever tried, awesome !. I went there at night and made the tasting menu with sashimi.To emphasize the one of razor with shiso, the one of tuna with quail egg and the one of wharf. Obviously the bull and others you expect to be great but the three I mentioned were a big surprise.On the other hand the environment is really very comfortable and the treatment of both the waiters and the sushi chef himself is brilliant. A place to go when the economy allows, as it is not cheap, but if you have the chance do not hesitate. Needless to say, at noon they have much more affordable menus so it‚Äôs another good option (which for work reasons is harder for me).\n",
      "A must if you are a sushi lover. Open, intimate and select kitchen. Exquisite tasting menu.I recommend booking in advance.\n",
      "Impeccable, fantastic, incredible. It's a trip to Japan, from the place that is amazing to a perfect professional in command of one of the bars. Fish is the best thing I ate in Barcelona. The discreet and impeccable service. I think he's the best Japanese in Barcelona.\n",
      "Excellent treatment, spectacular product ...We will be back!!\n",
      "Very happy, a very cozy small place. Eating prepared before you, spectacular. And it could come every day if it were not for the price üòÇ. Very good place to go as a couple occasionally. The attention is very and very correct, good advice and a lot of patience. And I'll make sure again.\n",
      "Sato San brushes excellence in every piece he makes with his hands. It is a pleasure to observe the care with which the ingredients are treated and even more taste their creations. A must in Barcelona. The ‚Ç¨ 65 from the night tasting menu was worth it.\n",
      "Local authentic Japanese cuisine, only 24 people per service, elegance, exclusivity, very good attention, instant cuisine where the product is the protagonist, excellent and it shows, very correct staff and very correct prices, to highlight the variety of niguiris , which go according to market and dessert the mouse of edamame, brutal !!!!Congratulations!!!\n",
      "Japanese bar worth visiting. They have a small menu but with an excellent quality in what they have. The only thing weaker were the desserts, but it is common in Japanese restaurants since they do not like sweet. But in terms of fresh fish it is the best I've ever had. They also knew how to recommend a good sake to accompany our dinner.\n",
      "You can eat delicious sushi.[Update] Second meal. It was delicious as usualThere are two types of (set) menus, the one with sashimi and the other with tempura. The second time I had tempura, but the vegetable tempura was delicious.In the menu, after sashimi or tempura, about 15 cans of sushi will be served.All are very delicious and go well with sakeSome of the shops are familiar with sake, so it's best to ask for recommendations and make a match! ‚Ä•There seem to be various desserts, but I chose matcha ice cream.\n",
      "Maem√≠a. Touch the sky with the back of postpucio\n",

      "Spectacular tasting menu. Authentic experience and with very good value for money.\n",
      "We booked for today through the website months ago and it is very difficult to reserve and we received a confirmation email so we were very happy. Well here we are, agreed date and time in front of the restaurant that is CLOSED. What irony especially when they end their mail with a \"thank you for placing your trust in us\". What a disappointment the truth.\n",
      "Spectacular. We did the evening tasting menu and absolutely loved all the dishes. We were at the Tanaka bar and had a great time. Super recommended!\n",

      "Product 10 and round experience from master Komuta\n",
      "Amazing! We took the long tasting menu accompanied by sake. Some spectacular nigiris. On the other hand, tempura was worthless, but it is an unimportant detail. We will repeat. It is essential to book well in advance.\n",
      "Simply ES-PEC-TA-CU-LAR !!! Enjoy the sushi while contemplating the mastery of the chef in preparing it. High quality raw material and very attentive service. I love it!!!\n",
      "Best Japanese in Barcelona to ask nigiris or maki. short letter and that makes it even better. Sato table and / or Tanaka. Bar for 8 people. 2 bars. In area bars and drinks. We repeat again and again. You have to book a long but long. Long live Sato and Tanaka\n",
      "It's like going back to Japan. Small place with two bars, sushi made in front of you, excellent.\n",

      "Spectacular Japanese restaurant in the center of Barcelona. Japanese restaurant as in Japan. Super fresh and care product. Excellent service, very friendly and close. Price more than affordable if you keep in mind that you have a Japanese chef in front of you and cooking for you. Surely we will return. The food without shrillness or frills. Simple and always giving relevance to the product that is noticeable that it is fresh and of a high quality.\n",
      "Excellent product quality, presentation and attention. The entire restaurant is in spectacular bar format. A lot of silence in a pleasant environment that allows you to chat very comfortably. I need to put plates and napkins. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Small place to eat high quality sushi while the sushiman prepares the dishes in front of you. A place to go without rushing. Highlights include the tasting menus. It is recommended to book.\n",
      "If you want to enjoy a 100% Japanese experience and a high quality product, Sato i Tanaka is your restaurant.

      "As a Japanese who lives here, it is a shame that people judge Japanese foods and sake as fake. It is a place where you can eat authentic Japanese sushi and sake for reasonable prices.

This restaurant belonging to the group of Kan Kenji has seemed to me the best that I have tried in terms of Japanese cuisine of everything I have been able to try in Barcelona.Any item on the menu is close to perfection.Having eaten in the very Tokyo fish market I can say that they are by far the best Nigiris in Barcelona.Congratulations for your great work.\n",
      "One of the best Japanese in Barcelona! Highly recommended. Great service.\n",
      "My favorite Japanese in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãby far. It's crazy.\n",

      "Simply incredible. The best sushi in all of Barcelona.\n",
      "A gastronomic experience. I have never enjoyed sushi as much as here, and look, I have been to restaurants ...\n",
      "Impressive Japanese sushi bar restaurant. The place has a modern but traditional air at the same time, and is spotless, every detail is taken care of. Only 15 diners can be accommodated at the same time, divided into two bars. It's a sight to see Sato or Tanaka wielding knives a meter away. Millimeter precision. And they delight you with careful dishes with subtle aromas. We ordered the tasting menu: 55 euros with dessert included (separate drink) perfectly reversed. Each dish, each nigiri, a joy. We spent two hours dining, which went by very quickly. A restaurant for a special evening. Spectacular.\n",
      "Two sushi bars, two cooks. They prepare each piece of sushi in front of you. Relaxed atmosphere. They offer several menus at lunchtime, with excellent quality / price ratio. 100% recommendable.\n",
      "Excellent, takes you to Japan really looking forward to returning\n",
      "If you want good sushi this is your restaurant prepared by chefs Sato and Tanaka\n",

      "The best sushi in Barcelona with the shunka group. The weekday lunch menu is excellent.\n",
      "An inescapable experience. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Spectacular. The best sushi I have eaten. The delicacy of the sushi-man and the quality of the pieces of fish, is outstanding. An experience to remember. We took the large-nigiri menu, and we were satisfied in terms of quantity. ‚Ç¨ 27 I think I remember, with starter, miso soup, makis and carousel of nigiris all different. Recommended for everyone.I leave you photo of the tuna nigiri and the eel nigiri, so that you appreciate the quality of the product. The tuna fish is an ORGAS ** VISUAL\n",
      "Reference sushi bar in Barcelona. In this small restaurant you come to eat sushi and little else (which is not little). Austerity is the prevailing norm, without stridency, or mergers, or even noise. Two sushi man and a waiter for drinks. That is all. A very high quality raw material and a short but careful wine list. It was about time a place like this in Barcelona for sushi lovers. Fairly cheap price, around ‚Ç¨ 40 with a drink. By the way, quite public Japanese which indicates the level of the joint.\n",
      "Best and most authentic sushi in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwithout exaggeration. You literally feel in Japan\n",
      "An experience. 100% recommendable.\n",

      "Very good sushi and its sushichef is a crash.\n",
      "Spectacular. We were at the back bar with Kenji. We chose a menu for ‚Ç¨ 55 per person, and I must say that it is worth every p ** or euro you pay. Impeccable service, great product, apparently very simple dishes, but with many nuances. Accompanied by sake, a drink that I did not like until I tried this one (kid Junmai daiginjo). Special mention to the tuna gunkan with quail egg. Best Japanese I've been to in bcn together with Wakasa.\n",
      "If you fancy a Japanese gastronomic experience, this is your restaurant. Possibly you will have to book in advance since the restaurant is not very big, it fits few people and the experience is long. Sato or Tanaka will cook in front of you and they will serve you the sashimi, nigiris, makis, etc ... and everything is luxurious. Affordable price for everyone. Do not miss it\n",
      "Spectacular! Repeat for sure!\n",
      "Excellent product, too picky sushi and very narrow wine list.\n",
      "The best sushi in Barcelona and that's it\n",
      "The quality of the fish is very good, but for my taste the taste of the rice vinegar is too strong and the taste of the fish is eaten. The service is not particularly friendly. I have been to restaurants like this in other cities and the chefs were nicer. Not bad but maybe I expected more.\n",
      "Fantastic experience, one of the best Japanese you can find in Barcelona\n",
      "The fancy restaurant.With good cuisine.Has parking for customersFor 2 people we have paid 95 euros\n",

      "Very nice place, attentive and professional. It is expensive, but the product is of high quality and generous portions. It's worth what you pay.\n",
      "Classic in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa properly Barcelona clientele familiar with this type of historic restaurant where the service is part of the charm as well as its cuisine. It has parking, which makes it much easier to attend this recommended restaurant.\n",
      "Relaxed atmosphere of a bourgeois and institutional Barcelona with careful dedication to table service.Despite the concurrence, everyone‚Äôs discretion stands out.\n",
      "This is not the seafood restaurant. It is the Trit√≥n bar-restaurant that I suppose will have something to do with the other because there is no option to find it. You eat very fast and the price is excellent quality.\n",
      "I do not think about the restaurant, because I have known it for years, however the bar is terrible, horrible and fatal ... I almost vomited, and whoever is interested in asking, close NOW! Public health ...Close bar! Lack of hygiene, terrible attention, horrible ...\n",

      "Good product quality and good service .....! And they have parking !!!\n",

      "Simply exceptional, champions product, service to match the product and beautiful premises with indoor parking.\n",

      "Good place to eatAttention and speed\n",
      "Neighborhood restaurant in the middle of the universities area. Friendly waiters and classic local without decorum. Bright and spacious. There is no menu and the menu is varied. Reasonable prices. The bravas well, the macaroni au gratin also and the homemade meatballs not so good (a little dry inside, the sauce good)\n",
      "Very good restaurant. The menu of the day is very good, to highlight the seconds of great quality in meat and fish, it is a place that never fails. And the staff ... friendly and very helpful. As a point of improvement, I would suggest including information on the main allergens in the menu and on the menu (gluten, egg, nuts, etc.)\n",
      "It is without a doubt a restaurant of reference.A classic, elegant space, where we should all be able to stop sometime to relax and enjoy its excellent room service that maintains tradition and absolute professionalism.As for the little space to say, it speaks for itself. It is magical to find a place like this hidden inside a large block of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãso well landscaped and outside, it is one of those spaces that when the sun goes down and the night is seen, the lighting that it possesses strongly enhances its nobility.Undoubtedly, it is accompanied by a great Mediterranean cuisine with unbeatable fresh fish and seafood of the highest quality and cooked in detail with its cooked to the point and with sensitivity. I would also highlight its classic menu and its little nod to Japan that will surprise even those in the know. It is a real scandal.If there were an emblem, a flag, some colors, a name that represented quality and tradition, it would undoubtedly be TRITON.Great restaurateurs, experts in the field. A place without a doubt essential in Barcelona.\n",

      "Although it maintains the level with details such as own parking or a very attentive and careful service, the proposal is not original for the level of the restaurant, although of quality. A classic seafood restaurant of the whole of life. A light dinner (first shared, a dessert ...) for 5 people at about ‚Ç¨ 50 each.\n",
      "Of all life ... You can't fail\n",
      "Very quiet space, where you have a good breakfast and good food, even so there is a lack of waiters, they go boiled and this is seen in service, they go slow and stressed, even so it eats well and is priced enough reasonable.

They have enabled both the exterior patio and two interior rooms with views of the city. Now, in times of a pandemic, I would recommend either the patio or the small room. The cal√ßotada menu includes two tiles of cal√ßots, a second of meat, desserts, drinks and coffee, all for 35 euros. The quality is good, although it is missed that the cal√ßots are unlimited as in other menus. The homemade cake, very rich. I would recommend updating the menus on the web as the waitress told us that the information was not valid.\n",

I commented to him that at the time of booking I had already asked to make cal√ßots and then suddenly they already had them! When I ordered there were already dishes that they didn't have anymore and it wasn't so late ... The service was very busy, I don't blame them, the volume of people was powerful. Despite ordering between the remaining dishes they changed one of our orders because there was no left. The amount of cal√ßots is scarce, only one tile per person and they do not give orange between the cal√ßots and the grilled meat.

The day before, when trying to book right at the restaurant's opening time, they told us that they had already taken the terrace reservations in previous days and that, in addition, it was going to rain. Fatal, we are not even going to consider trying to go again ... And if you want to book, make sure they do not lie to you because you have many numbers to run out of a table (they are only for colleagues ...)\n",
      "Very bad treatment. They don't pick up the phone and if they do it is in very bad ways. I reserved a table and the day before when I call to confirm they tell me that they are not full. The food may already be very tasty, but I still would not go.\n",
      "CAN MART√ç ... WHAT T'EST√Ä PASSANT?What happens to you Can Mart√≠?Can Mart√≠ has ‚Äã‚Äãalways been a point of reference as a \"picnic area\", an easy and good restaurant within its simple menus that help you not to have to decide ...... I have been going back and forth regularly for 30 years at fantastic dinners for large groups, friends, intimate and even work ...... ALWAYS WELL without the need for change and with 5-star ratings for the freshness and kindness of the treatment ... a whole set of well-understood simplicities that made everything easy there ...BUT...... I came back a few weeks ago and was surprised that the menu options had been eliminated ... A point of surprise and sadness but that is assumed if the menu responds to the same spirit traditionally offered ...... basic food well done ...When ordering the truth is that we were a bit negatively surprised by the abundance of the portions of simple things.One of the dishes that we ordered was some bravas and the portion was more than scarce ... it reminded me in quantity of the volume of Tom√†s de Sarri√† but with the Can Mart√≠ formalization ...... if you want to compare with before and that portion was a third of the old portions ...I will return but I think it will lose the charisma that differentiated it and it is becoming ANOTHER RESTAURANT ......... nostalgia for recent times past ... a year ago it still hadn't changed and everything was as before ...\n",
      "Good views, good food and live music in the afternoon.\n",
      "A spectacular place ... between pine forests and views of Barcelona ... the first class service is worth going both in summer and in winter I have been in both times\n",
      "Incredible place, delicious food at a good price and unbeatable service. The views are also noteworthy! A site of 10, wow.\n",
      "Super good product, good views, good service! Very simple and basic place. Cumbersome to get to but it's part of the charm. We will definitely repeat.\n",
      "Very good grilled meat, family atmosphere and incredible views of Barcelona. Ideal for an outdoor outing in the city. We will repeat !!\n",
      "Price quality not recommended. Treatment by unfortunate and out of place owner. I recommend other restaurants\n",
      "I give them 4 stars because the service has been great, very friendly and attentive. Too bad small details (like too many cal√ßots, for my taste and a couple of things +) Pxo could have a 5 stars if these little details worked a little +\n",
      "The treatment was unbeatable, we arrived without reservation and a little late and had no problem sitting down. The food was very good. Everything we tasted we liked a lot.To put a stick is a bit badly signaled. The entrance sign does not look good.\n",
      "The last time we were there was a bit disastrous but the regents have changed and now it has improved a lot! Prices have risen, but there is much more service and friendlier.Recommendable!\n",
      "Typical Catalan cuisine. The food is good and the place is nice with good views. Access a bit complicated by the area and parking depends on the volume of people, it can be difficult due to the slope. The cal√ßots were very rich and the service was attentive.\n",
      "One of the best places I have stepped on in Barcelona. Good cal√ßots, tremendously good dishes, quality home cooking. And rumba, music and good vibes galore.\n",
      "Good!!!! Good food and good fresh on a hot night in the city.\n",
      "Friendly, good quality food. We will be back, for sure.\n",
      "The worst romesco sauce I've ever tasted (very liquid and with very little or no nuts in the mix) ... Too bad it's worth the cal√ßots menu and the spectacular views of the poorly maintained place.The garnish of the dishes is very scarce.Very good staff attention.\n",
      "Good food and attention. Great view and space for a sunny day. Remarkable: the baby changer is in the men's bathroom, well ahead!\n",
      "Charming place with very friendly service and delicious homemade food. The atmosphere is unbeatable\n",
      "The best beef rice I've ever had. Incredible one hundred percent recommended. Homemade food and with love.\n",
      "An excellent site. Very good food of enormous quality, super nice service and views of all of Barcelona. Some great cal√ßots.\n",
      "We loved it! A jewel in the middle of the Cam√≠ de les Aig√ºes.Very friendly staff and very good food.We will return without a doubt\n",
      "Good food, quiet and with incredible views\n",
      "Good deal, good food. What more could you want?\n",
      "Fantastic cal√ßots and other dishes, too. The view of Barcelona from there, magnificent\n",
      "Perhaps the best place to make cal√ßots in Barcelona. Clambered over the waterway. It is a long climb and it costs to park. Great views. Very attentive service\n",
      "The entrecote was very good, the calcotes and the sauce very tight.\n",
      "We called on Thursday to reserve and they told us they were not booking outside because it was raining and they said to call on Saturday at 10. We called again on Friday seeing that the forecast changed and they repeated the same thing.And today we call at 10 and they tell us they're sorry but they already have everything booked.\n",
      "A quiet place, good food and good views of Barcelona.\n",
      "Good place for spoon breakfast after doing the road to the waters. Better to make a reservation\n",
      "This restaurant has an absolutely privileged location, a simple but good cuisine and a familiar treatment\n",
      "Great location\n",
      "Very good meats. Desserts and mojitos leave something to be desired\n",
      "An excellent place in the mountains. It costs a little to get there because you have to go by car yes or yes, but it is worth going. The views are spectacular, I don't know if there will be another restaurant in Barcelona with better views. A marvel. We ate menu cal√ßots, ‚Ç¨ 35 per person, just perfect (nothing expensive for the place and quality). The cal√ßots well made and rich sauce, then entrec√¥te de sec (there are several things to choose from) very tasty. It comes with accompaniment and bread with tomato. The dessert is homemade and is enjoyed a lot after the harton of previous food. The cheese cake ... I would go back almost alone for that cake. 100% recommended the place. Excellent. You have to ask for a reservation in advance because it is full. However, the atmosphere is very good, you don't feel like there are many people. As points to improve: the wine justea a little and the air conditioning too. Still great experience that exceeded our expectations by far. Gem in the mountain.\n",
      "The fatal food, we have ordered cal√ßots and they were totally charred. They serve grilled Carme super fast because they already have it prepared and it is cold. Saturated and they do not give vast because it is the only one there is. But I have to admit that the attention of the staff was great. Felipe has attended us and has been super attentive.\n",
      "Well\n",
      "A restaurant where you eat very well, environment and very pleasant staff. We will repeat\n",
      "I treat 10 diners and view the spectacular coastline, the food is better not to comment because I am short\n",
      "Family atmosphere and very good grilled meat !! To highlight the chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãcroquettes, spectacular!\n",
      "They brought us the dishes fast and it was yummy! Spacious and open air !!\n",
      "I don't know the food or the service is better, fantastic place and with stunning views\n",
      "We ate fabulously and from 18-20 they play live music on the terrace with a very good atmosphere\n",
      "Precious and delicious one of the best places to see Barcelona from above while you eat.\n",
      "A good place to go to eat! The attention is very correct, they are efficient and friendly. Food with a value for money. The space is very clean but quite sloppy. Cheers!\n",
      "Spectacular\n",
      "A 10 for this restaurant. You eat luxury in a natural environment. Pleasant treatment and quality price very good.\n",
      "Atmosphere, from 10. Food, turn the meat over; If it falls on the embers, it will strain you the same\n",
      "The cal√ßots are very good.\n",
      "To eat calsots is without a doubt theBest place. The panoramic view of Barcelona is priceless and the excellent service. Don't pretend luxury if everything else.\n",
      "I called to reserve several times, as they did not pick up the phone we decided to stop by. They were full, and they told me that I should call ahead to reserve.Today I have called again 3 times in their schedule, they hang up on me, it's not that they don't pick it up .... they hang up.Apparently they have plenty of customers.\n",
      "Great place to eat and great views on your deck. I tried their grilled meat and it is great and the people who served us very friendly. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Small and modern place with a warm and welcoming design. In front of it we have a small terrace, especially for vermouth and tapas.They have a variety menu in 8meat, fish, tapas and rice but very short. I have to assume that they have a small kitchen and at the moment they can't eat more than about 25 people at the same time.The service is very attentive and nice, the stove product is good (angus meat), fresh fish and variety of tapas.Yes, you can go with a discount from a famous app and in hours the final bill is already very interesting.They have to improve (keep in mind) the wine and cavas menu (it is very short). It is very good to make individual pans (they have 4 but the d, black dry rice with squid and the d, duck with pumpkin are very good).You can find pk. by the surroundings in blue zone or the private one.\n",
      "I was surprised to see an average score of 4.1 on his file because the food was actually delicious. The oxtail croquettes were personally the best I've ever eaten, the burrata with pesto is very well balanced and the duck and pumpkin rice did it all! I loved it loved it. I left happy and I want to go back!\n",
      "I have loved this place, all the food was great, I don't have any \"buts\" about this restaurant. The phenomenal attention, the girl who attended us was super nice and attentive. We really liked the cachopo, the paella and the good ones with squid. I recommend it 100%. It has a terrace and we got the sun until 4 pm.\n",
      "All very tasty\n",
      "It eats well and the price is reasonable. TheGastronomy is modern and rice is the best. Fully recommended if you are by theZone. The staff is friendly, close and pleasant, that if the q seems to be the owner or manager shines for its lack of professionalism and customer service. The rest a 10. The place is not very big but neither is cozy. It would only improve if it was more comfortable in terms of tables.\n",
      "Very nice place with outdoor terrace. As for the food, I tried the lunch menu and I was disenchanted, good presentation, I tried 2 dishes and dessert without any charm or flavor. I am left feeling that I paid a lot for a very simple meal.\n",
      "Simply exquisite. I have ordered the menu of the day, and the dishes very well prepared and with a soft and personal flavor.The price is fully justified, a little above the average in Barcelona. The place is also cozy and elegant.I leave wanting to return.\n",
      "Different vermouths to choose from, many dishes that taste good, also rice dishes. Local small but with terrace. Average price of lunch about ‚Ç¨ 30, lunch menu for ‚Ç¨ 15.90. All very well, except the tables, they have their legs very close together and they are uncomfortable, however, it is a recommended place.\n",
      "For 13 euros we ordered a tonic gin that had no more than a finger of gin. A great frustration.\n",
      "The place is very nice. Your product is top quality. Hence, its price is also high. The portions are not too big. They have vermouth varieties. The menus are great too as are their homemade desserts. Excellent service.\n",
      "Exceptional paella and black fideua. Superb starters and desserts.Fantastic quality, quantity and price.Very interesting the area and the characteristics of the premises.Everything great to look good and eat better.Congratulations to the team and especially to the chef (V√≠ctor Salvador) and the owner of the restaurant.\n",
      "We had maki de aguacate, croquetas de jamon, las bravas, arroz de marisco and taco de pollo. All good to look at and good, the only thing the taco was not to my taste ...The bill was quite high compared to the not very big dishes (especially arroz), luckily we had booked with tenedor with a 30% discount even if at the time of paying \"if they forgot it\" ... the cashier did not seem very surprised and the waiter had his face on the ground ... they gave me the impression of having tried (in Barcelona it happens with tourists).I don't go back anymore, mostly because it didn't drive me crazy, there are better places.\n",
      "Good food and place\n",
      "Good food and very well presentedIdeal for chopping and sharing dishes\n",
      "Very good food, the oxtail croquettes, exquisite. Pleasent treatment. Small premises.\n",
      "Very good and tasty menu! We have gone two couples and we have left very satisfied üëåüèª\n",
      "Very good food and excellent service. A great site.\n",
      "Good tapas and a first class rice. The lical is very bright and very well located\n",
      "It has changed a lot and it is not the same and the girl alone to serve inside and on the terrace, adequate service brings you bread at the end, the girl attends you with sharp answers, all in micro sauces not appropriate to meat, it was better with a little bit of oil and cheaper I don't come back again,\n",
      "On the terrace the price rises 10% of the menu. The menu is reduced although the food was good. We ordered oysters, croquettes, artichokes (the best of the food) and black rice with squid (it has enough pieces of green pepper, if you do not like its flavor, do not ask). To finish homemade tiramisu.\n",
      "Very friendly waiter. The sea bass was spectacular. Angus meat my friends tmb loved it. And the desserts are very good. The truth is that we were delighted\n",
      "We ordered paella, it really surprised us, it was really delicious. A 10 for the kitchen and for the waiters who attended us.\n",
      "Great, nice place, very good elaborate food, a little expensive but worth it. Attentive and fast. I recommend calamari, mussels, entrecote, paella ... very good desserts.\n",
      "The name deceives. Ideal for having a vermouth and tapas but even more recommended to stay to eat. They have several suggestions of the day and they prepare divine rice dishes!\n",
      "Nice restaurant to go with your partner or friends. The tapas are more than generous in size, and the presentation is very elaborate.We will repeat\n",
      "Charming, very cool and original place, you feel at home.The wonderful attention.It has a lot of tapas in addition to more elaborate dishes. Say they don't have dishes ...... If you're vegan ...It is not cheap but it is worth it.A clear 3 e, croquettes 2.50 unit, the tartar 13, cheese board 14 e.I put it on so you can see more or less where it goes. That siii all super rich.*** By the way, we made the reservation through the fork, so they applied a 30% discount on the food, so it came out quite well in price.And what to say that they also have a terrace.I hope to come back.You will tell me if you liked it !!!!\n",
      "Restaurant located in the center of the Eixample with beautiful decoration and very bright. They have a lunch menu from Monday to Friday at a very good price.\n",
      "Good place, very nice, but not for a drink. They have very few drinks.\n",
      "I go here many times. The last time we went, the paella was a JOKE. The seafood on top was not cooked. There was blood on the prawns and the mussels were black inside. With all due respect, we have said that you cannot eat paella like this. The waitress - whatever the chef herself - told us with a very bad face that the seafood was cooked in water. Ok - all good - but they were NOT cooked. The same in the water or not. Instead of saying sorry, the waitress insisted that for 7 years this is the case. Man! 7 or 20 .. the seafood was not cooked. Point. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Good food! And good prices. Top atmosphere\n",
      "Most of the dishes can be improved.\n",
      "The Menu is very good with exquisite Mediterranean flavors, especially they have delicious rice dishes, in fact I have tried several but the richest is undoubtedly the black rice :) as well as the tapas that are elaborated and well presented; I like the lighting and the atmosphere.With this I tell you that it is highly recommended!\n",
      "Do not miss your after work!\n",
      "Very authentic place to enjoy a wide variety of vermouths, as well as a variety of cavas and wines.Vermouth from the house of Reus for ‚Ç¨ 2.75Wide menu for tapas or eating.Inside calm environment, elephant with good musicOutside wide terrace in a street with little traffic\n",
      "The food was exquisite and they treated us terrific\n",
      "We made a reservation for 6 people at the Fork. Due to covid restrictions, the maximum allowed is 6 people. They called us from the restaurant to confirm if we really confirmed the reservation, and we have confirmed it. The reservation cancellation email arrives 15 minutes away. Luckily I have seen it, otherwise we would go there and be left with nothing. I have called the restaurant's phone again asking for explanations and the answer has been that the restaurant has no capacity and has apologized. The question is why it was not possible to notify already in the first call instead of sending an automatic mail?\n",
      "The place is very nice and the homemade vermouth is really good.I have not had the opportunity to try anything from the food menu but I will surely soon!The attention is not friendly at all from the waitress.\n",
      "Great place, good food\n",
      "The waiters are very attentive and friendly. Food was very good\n",
      "Some original dishes and tapas, with Asian touches and very good! A good surprise, I'll be back!\n",

      "We went for Valentine's day, the food was very good,I recommend 100%\n",
      "Good oysters and very friendly and helpful staff\n",
      "A very nice restaurant, a menu with high quality raw materials, everything we have ordered was excellent, the service is very friendly and attentive, and they follow all the Covid-19 protocols, highly recommended!\n",
      "Very good service, nice atmosphere, cool place, very good wine but expensive food for what it is\n",
      "Disappointing, we went there to eat the menu THAT THEY ADVERTISE ON THEIR WEBSITE and it turns out that they no longer do it, that the page is not updated, THAT IS MISLEADING ADVERTISING. The right amounts and when ordering a burrata salad, instead of bringing a burrata, they gave us 3 TROCITOS. We will not repeat.\n",
      "Nice place to have a vermouth and nibble on very good dishes. The octopus is recommended.\n",
      "Pleasant, magnificent attention and magnificent flavors\n",
      "Very bad experience. The food is very expensive and although it is not bad it is not worth its price. The service was not good for us. We wanted to share a rice and they brought us a double portion, even though we clarified when ordering. The XL croquettes have nothing XL. And they charge a 10% surcharge for the \"terrace\", in full pandemic. We will not return and we do not recommend it.\n",
      "Excellent place\n",
      "Excellent service, good value for money and ageadable and cozy place\n",
      "Daily menu always including excellent rice. recommendable\n",
      "Not bad to peck, a little scarce in variety, but good. In my case, I was quite cold. Friendly waiter and the right atmosphere\n",
      "Good atmosphere and service\n",
      "The best rice in the eixample! The Iberico with seafood was spectacular!\n",
      "Nice place, high prices on the terrace ...\n",
      "Nice atmosphere, good food and good service. A little expensive, we left well pq we had booked with El Tenedor and we had a little discount.\n",
      "Excellent. Great service and sophisticated, different and very tasty food. Good presentation and very decisive with any request. We will be back. We have gone with our grandparents and family. Modern and youthful style.\n",
      "We were a group of 20 people and we all loved black rice, the house specialty. Very attentive service. Don't miss out on trying the desserts, the one with violet ice cream is exquisite. Highly recommended\n",
      "Good noon formula with original dishes that come out of the typical ABC. Being Friday, we were able to enjoy a generous fideu√° of ribs, sausage and artichokes that we liked enough to be part of a noon menu. We will return to try a rice of the menu :-)\n",
      "A great place. All very good and excellent treatment. I will come back and recommend it.\n",
      "Quality Catalan Food\n",
      "To have something to eat before eating. Good deal\n",
      "Local very cozy. The service is excellent, they made us feel at home. We had dinner um steak tartar and some Iberian-style rice dishes (which were Iberian) that they had recommended and met the expectations. We wanted to taste the cakes. But there was no room for much more. We have split a coulan ... Excellent .. We will return to keep discovering more ...\n",
      "I went twice to the menu noon and I love, just price, courteous service and food quality varied and with a gourmet touch\n",
      "This is not the first time we have come and we are still very pleased. We have made a nice meal of friends. Today we have used the daily menu. Plates carefully presented and very good. Very good customer service!\n",
      "It is one of my favorite places in BCN. I have been a customer for years. I am very sorry that COVID prevents them from having the establishment as before, but it continues with its charm.\n",
      "Classic and bestial !! üòçüòçüòçüòç\n",
      "Very good experience. Very excellent service and a place not \"overcrowded\" to have a drink in the late afternoon.\n",
      "Rather just dishes, as in many places of the same style in Barcelona. Of course, they are good, but if you are a big eater it is expensive. Another issue is having offers from the Fork, even so for what they offer ... The place is cozy, the service is good, of that no complaints. They are fast and attentive, and I insist, the food is good, but what about the portions ...\n",
      "Modern place with good menu to snack or eat. Friendly service\n",
      "Great! We will repeat !!\n",
      "We went to eat for the rice and nothing to do with what they were before. Tasteless and past. Apparently he is no longer the Valencian chef who had great talent. Too bad I don't think we're back.\n",
      "Good wine list, good service and acceptable food.\n",
      "Spectacular quality and creativity of the dishes as well as 100% recommended attention\n",
      "Eating at noon at La Vermuterie is like going a la carte at a set price. They have four first and four seconds, delicious desserts and drinks. The dishes are exquisite and innovative; sometimes they surprise the combination of flavors. It is worth noting the paellas and fideu√°s, as they are some of the best in Barcelona. In few restaurants they have these elaborate dishes on the menu. 100% recommended.\n",
      "Incredible location, in the center of Barcelona. Perfect balance between service and quality, accompanied by a pleasant and warm setting.Highly recommended, especially for its rice dishes :)Right price!!\n",
      "The paella is very good and the desserts too! I advise you to eat there without a doubt\n",
      "Very good munu tartare and rice also very good. The only downside though, was the service which was a bit slow.\n",
      "A special place, warm and personal.\n",
      "Very good. Nice place. Efficient service. Careful cooking. I recommend the beef tartar steak (now I see it in the friar. I think it was a la carte), very good. I ordered it spicy and it was ready.\n",
      "La Vermuterie combines the quality of seasonal cuisine with the friendliness of the staff in a perfect location. The lunch menu could be defined as eating a la carte at a menu price (‚Ç¨ 15.90). Totally recommended!\n",
      "To go as a couple is perfect! Super cozy and you eat very well! The cuisine they have is of a level I recommend the vegetable rice!\n",
      "Small bar with excellent tapas and vermouths.Very expensive value for money.\n",
      "We had a company party. Food good enough. The attention is a bit off. We had agreed to have the room until 4 and shortly after 3 they already started removing us.\n",
      "Very good food, presentation, excellent service and a very nice and cozy place. The exquisite dessert. I would eat again without a doubt.\n",
      "Good vermouth, fresh fish and good service. Beautiful place although it looks neglected in the details (dust, a lot of dust in its lamps that should be a claim and not vice versa), papers hooked without a frame on the walls, that already put a pass of balleta, it would not be bad for them.\n",
      "A cozy place, very friendly service and delicious food\n",
      "Quite disappointing, I'm sorry but the paella is inedible, very hard and burnt rice, since you pay enough unless it is of good quality. ‚Ç¨ 20 the paella / per person. As for meat, it's not bad at all. The problem the small amount. I am surprised by the good reviews that the place has. we will not repeat.\n",
      "Perfect tapas place! with very good vermouths and amazing rice dishes! in the center of the left widening! we will repeat! Highly advisable\n",
      "The place is nice. I had a super good paella. Although for my taste vermouth I did not like much. The bravas that were served undercooked, but the sauce was very good. Attentive waiters.\n",
      "A very elegant and cozy restaurant for both meetings and lunch\n",
      "Quiet dinner. Cozy local. Very good service. Elaborate and tasty dishes.\n",
      "Yummy üëçBrought by friends from Barcelona who ordered for us, various different dishes to taste, all yummy. I advise.\n",
      "Good kitchen Small portions. Without the promotion discount it is expensive. Friendly service but a little slow.\n",
      "Third time we repeat .... Oxtail croquettes and very good rice dishes. Non-stop kitchen and attentive service.\n",
      "Eating one of the best rice dishes in Barcelona. Always enjoying the Good Company.\n",
      "A restaurant with tapas that gives very good service. Very good. Croquettes are recommended!\n",
      "Wide variety of dishes, with top quality products and an exquisite result. The staff is very attentive.\n",
      "Very good tapas and rice dishes\n",
      "We had a reservation for over a week and they told us they had to relocate us on the terrace. It was cold, but it was that or dining at the bar. Then we saw that it was because they had a birthday inside. That is, my reservation is worthless if a large group comes to dinner. It is a lack of respect. At least they could have called to warn. As if that were not enough when I get the bill, I had been charged the terrace supplement where I did not want to be in all the dishes! After claiming more or less they returned it to me but with reservations and telling me that, of course, it was on the terrace ... I will not return.\n",
      "The tapas very good, although very small for its price. The calamari and asparagus omelette is delicious. Slow service, but if you're not in a hurry, it's worth it.\n",
      "Artichokes overheated, tuna belly low, service very poor ... Much to improve.\n",
      "Whenever we go to this restaurant, we are delighted, both with friends and with family. We will certainly come more times. The oxtail croquettes are the best we have ever eaten. Thank you\n",
      "The best croquettes in a long time. Is it worth it!\n",
      "Very good and good price\n",
      "The best oysters in Barcelona! Good wine list! Spectacular deal! We liked!\n",
      "Lunch menu of 16 euros very rich and excellent value for money. Everything very well presented and very fast service.\n",
      "Very welcoming, very friendly and attentive service\n",
      "Highly recommended !! If you are hungry this is your place! Good amounts!\n",
      "A place where you know you will not fail. Perfect location in the heart of Barcelona. We went on a Thursday night, so there weren't many people; but the treatment was very correct and I would say quite fast, especially when bringing all the dishes. The menu is quite extensive, so you can find all kinds of American food, and the truth is that everything is very good. Perhaps, and if I had to make a fault, I would say that the price is a bit high for the final amount of food, but anyway you are full with a starter and a main. Of course, it is very important to leave room for dessert. We tried the choco ball, and the truth is that an impressive chocolate explosion (warning, it costs a lot to finish!). Site without a doubt 100% recommended, pleasant atmosphere and delicious food.\n",
      "Very good place, very friendly people, the manager there is a crack, attention 10, food 10 great.\n",
      "Attentive and very friendly service.Good burgers and very good cakes.\n",
      "Exquisite treatment and perfect food as always\n",
      "The food is very good and the attention as a client has been very favorable, they have treated me like a queen\n",
      "I have been to many FosterHollywoods in Barcelona. This is the BEST xq cook the ingredients very well. The niches are always toasted and the ribs warm and tender, not like others that are only badly reheated and come to the table with cold bones.\n",
      "All very good, from hamburgers to desserts .. definitely go back üòé\n",
      "We have waited almost an hour for the food to be brought to us and in the end they forgot the starter. At least the staff was friendly !!!\n",
      "The ribs are very broken. And the desserts still make my mouth water just thinking about it\n",
      "My mother and I have had a wonderful dinner. The food has been excellent but what has fallen in love with us the most is the good service. Ibrahim from the first moment has made us smile and we have eaten very comfortably.\n",
      "American food. Burgers, sandwiches, nachos ... desserts. It has refill. Ideal for a fun casual meal.Good service.Lack of toilet in the sinks.Guide on Saturday and there were few people so although it does not have a terrace there was social distance. It has take away.\n",
      "Excellent value for money, especially when there are 2x1 promotions or the famous \"check\". In general the dishes are plentiful and tasty, highlighting the ribs and burgers. The desserts are good although exaggerated in the sweet (very Yankee style of mixing 10 things). The service is good, they are always very friendly. Recommended if you want to give yourself a binge of meat without going bankrupt. What are better ones? Without a doubt, but they are also much more expensive.\n",
      "The delicious food and the excellent attention from the waiters and the manager Ibo. Recommended 100%\n",
      "Excellent food as always, good quality and amazing product\n",
      "We had not been to the restaurant for years and I have to say that it has not lost an ounce of quality. Large portions, perfectly presented with an attentive, fast and very well attended staff. A 10 !!\n",
      "I have loved the daily menu. Great value for the price. The one from Balmes, huh ?? And super friendly manager. I will repeat and recommend.\n",
      "Very good food and at a good price for the amount they serve you!\n",
      "Good staff, good atmosphere, the essence of a Foster, we had dinner and we watched the Switzerland-France game and it was great. By the way the food is very careful in its presentation and taste.\n",
      "the attention of the waiters takes the cake, the waiters are very attentive, friendly and efficient, it's a pleasure to go to places where they serve you like this\n",
      "The attention has been the best, they are super attentive and they take care of you wonderfullyFood also good.I would go back without a doubt.\n",
      "The waiter treated us very kindly and the service was very correct all the time. Delicious dishes and without too much waiting time. If you want to eat well, it is a good place as the quality price and quantity of food is quite balanced.\n",
      "The menu is the same as all restaurants.The bread showed that it was thawed and had been there for days, hard and bland. The meat is very soft and rich, although the dishes came some cold because the 3 brought them together.We also ordered some cheese fingers and it was obvious that they were bagged, apart from being expensive they were very simple and bland.The milkshake also quite mediocre to bad, it was neither cold nor somewhat consistent. It was milk with a little chocolate powder (black choclate, since they don't put it on the menu or tell you) even though it put ice cream. The cream was rich and consistent for that.The new machine drink refill policy is fine.Service somewhat mediocre, but not bad.The place was nice and they played good music.The truth would not return, would go to another Foster's Hollywood.Mediocre restaurant compared to the entire chain.\n",
      "Well, but yummy. unhealthy but once a year does not hurt\n",
      "The worst burger of my life, without any doubt. We have ordered at home and the onion came like this. The meat is dry, tough and burned. Lower case. I would not repeat or make it free\n",
      "I wanted to know this chain, taking advantage of their 2x1 offer. With this offer there are some dishes that you cannot consume (which is understood) so we follow the recommendations of the guy who served us (excellent, by the way). The food was ok but the price is outrageous if you had to pay full. The hamburger meat is grilled but as if you made it at home. The potatoes were good, as was the presentation of the dishes. In short, it is a handsome place to visit when you want to treat yourself, as long as you take advantage of the promotions or menus. P.S. You can refill the drink as many times as you want.\n",
      "Very good attention, the waiter very attentive, and the hamburger and the males very rich.\n",
      "Excellent service and very tasty food\n",
      "Highly recommended, the food very good and the staff very attentive and pleasant. All a 10 .... I will definitely return .üëå\n",
      "The burgers ok. The potatoes are not worth it, neither of the two types that we provide. Very good service.\n",
      "Atmosphere is good, decorated with movie posters, cuddly 4 seats. Food was ok, good average not outstanding. Service was funny but not attentive. Wishes for meat was not considered.\n",
      "I have been to other Foster's and this is by far the one I liked the least.The place was gloomy and neglected, the food was not as good as usual and the service was pleasant, quite slow and not very attentive to the customer (we had to request that the dishes be removed, as they did not warn when we had finished and we were left with want to order another drink because we have not caught your attention)The ambient music the worst. Nothing nice to eat.\n",
      "The ribs are very rich, instead we ordered the hamburger to the point and they brought it quite done. The salad accompaniment, quite loose.\n",
      "I've been going to this site for years and it's a shame because it has gotten quite bad. The service is very good, but each time the presentation is worse, less quantity ... Today we have gone and the potatoes did not even come with mayonnaise / sauce, they have brought us 4 packages of ketchup and 2 of mustard for 3 people ... It has surprised a lot, really. It's no longer worth the price for this quality ... Not to mention the 4 cents they always charge you for your face ... hahahaA pity, but I think we will not return ...\n",
      "Here we go again! Generous portions, tasty meat and attentive and quick service. I never leave with a bad taste in my mouth!\n",
      "All correct .. Very good attention from the Latin girl who attended us ..\n",
      "I love food. You can see the quality price because it is a bit expensive but it is worth it for how good it is. Also the drink is recharged for free\n",
      "Delicious everything! Super filling! I recommend!\n",
      "For when you feel like eating \"fat\". Good flavor meat. They check point of meat.\n",
      "A good burger option with a fantastic daily menu, at a very good price. Friendly staff. Local themed.\n",
      "Good service, speed and variety to choose from for burgers, sandwiches and starters. Children's menu, with little details for the little ones, as well as a glass of drawings and colors so that they can paint while you are there\n",
      "I went for the first time to this restaurant and I was very surprised (positively) of the quality of the meat and especially the service. I had a great time and had a great evening. I will certainly come back for the New York cheesecake that I did not have the courage to take after the burger with 220g of meat and fries with cheese and bacon as input.I recommend !\n",
      "You eat very well. Too bad the website is a real disaster. The phone that comes out does not exist. And it gives you the option to reserve and do not make reservations.\n",
      "Foster's Foster's Foster's. Very correct lunch menu with good service. The menu is very fun and with delicious dishes within the line of all Foster's.\n",
      "For us it is the best Foster's, we have been going for years and we would not change it for anything in the world. The manager Ibrahim is a sweetheart.\n",
      "The director's choice never lets me down, great. The clean premises and the friendly and fast staff, no complaints.\n",
      "They do not respect the discounts that they send you to the mail and they apply it co.o they want the food well\n",
      "Experience totally outside the standards of the company.They served us without cutlery, we had to ask for them, the plate arrived totally cold, it had been an exaggerated time from made to received, to fill the drink it was practically impossible since I finished the first plate and half of the second I managed to fill. Totally unacceptable, on top of that we had a girl who had no desire to work\n",
      "100% recommended service, super nice and attentive !!!!\n",
      "All delicious and good service\n",
      "After a long time without being able to enjoy a meal in a restaurant, I have been to this one on Balmes street and both the food and the attention have been good. The only drawback has been that my daughter's dessert was a chocolate milkshake and they brought her a carton with a straw üôÑ instead of a smoothie in a crystal glass prepared with ice cream as it has been in other restaurants of this same chain (in Som Multiespai to give an example). We have been able to change it for an ice cream and this has improved the experience.\n",
      "Place set like a typical North American bar. The food is delicious. The average price. The price-quality ratio is good, although it could be better\n",
      "we like children a lotAlso\n",
      "On the website it says that they offer gluten-free food, but it is not true! If you are celiac, you cannot eat anything. Very badly. I ate the potatoes with ranch sauce and they were very bland, apart from the fact that they charged me ‚Ç¨ 9. Food is expensive and bad. I will definitely not return\n",
      "It is good like all Foster's, but right in this restaurant a cook has played a good or bad job, and eaten much better in other Foster's!\n",
      "Well prepared food, strong nachos (not like other places that give you half a portion)Perfect waiter attentionThe waiter who looks like romeo santos;) a crack many locals need people like that, greetings!\n",
      "Good service and attention ... even being a large group, food in abundance, so hungry do not stay!\n",
      "You already wanted to eat some bacon cheese fries, some nachos and a hamburger.Become Fosterians and you will receive offers to make it cheaper to eat here or at any other Foster restaurantTo enjoy\n",
      "It has been many years that I had not gone to eat and today because it is a special day with my daughters we decided to come today. It has been a great joy to me that everything is all was very good and the quality is still the same. The Flank Steak super tender with black beer the cheese fingers and the pasta Cavatappi Chicken pasta very good. And the lovely staff very clean and customer service very good. All the covid measures have been fulfilled .perfectly.\n",
      "Cozy place, with good quality and service. The price per person with a shared starter, main course and drink is around ‚Ç¨ 19\n",
      "Very good food, it was very good, second time and the friendliness of the waiters perfect\n",
      "Excellent attention service prices the girl who attended us from lovely venezuela, we will return for sure\n",
      "We went on Halloween, we had a great time!\n",
      "American food. This is, I suppose, its virtue. The meat a little done for my taste (we could to the point). Oh and little Hollywood decoration, a maximum poster.\n",
      "Although I liked the decoration before, it continues with the same menu as always and a very good service. They also have a lunch menu from 1pm and something that I think is fantastic.\n",
      "Good attention, excellent food. While they delayed bringing it, it was worth it\n",
      "There is a very good American kitchen restaurant, recommended for groups\n",
      "Now with the covid19 issue, can you go without booking? or you have to reserve yes or yes\n",
      "Very good, although the service has gone down a bit\n",
      "Very sad, there was no one, it was 4 in the afternoon and the girl told us that they were going to close, there was not a single diner ..... it's very sad how Barcelona is\n",
      "The staff very good. It's a bit expensive but if you can menu is better\n",
      "A little more time should be spent cleaning the bathrooms, a very important factor when we are talking about a restaurant.The restaurant's response is appreciated but I am not referring to the daily dirt that users cause. Review your cleaning procedure because there are areas that should see a brush more often.\n",
      "Great, we had a very good dinner\n",
      "Not bad, but the plans are somewhat worse compared to other places in the same chainI am not sure how to send messages, only to comment that the personal treatment is all perfect, but for example, the bacon cheese fries, less quantity than in other places, less cheese, less cheese sauce, .... they were like \"sad\"The rest of the dishes would say that they were already better\n",
      "Justito ...\n",
      "In other Fosters they give you a menu for 11 euros with 2 dishes plus dessert and a drink. Here they serve you only 1 dish and dessert plus a drink for 14 euros .. The single dishes are super expensive .. The nachos plate with everything very spicy and expensive. The potatoes are frozen .. For the price you pay at least things should be of quality.\n",
      "All very good üòÉ ...\n",
      "With the covid19 issue, can you go without booking or do you have to make a reservation?\n",
      "Very correct. On-time service. And great deal!\n",
      "I am a lover of American food and especially of the ribs (smoked pork ribs with barbecue) and I have tasted many in many places. If you are a lover I also recommend 100% the fosters. They are exquisite, they melt in your mouth you can choose more spicy less. Total in summary highly recommended. To part they have a very American system that is that you ask for a pepsi for example and they are filling it out !! Very well.\n",
      "The menu they have is quite good, all very rich and in large portions.\n",
      "Horrible, it is seen that it is backward and of poor quality. Impossible to finish the meal, even the food tends to be spicy even being a simple salad.\n",
      "I am a fan of pulled smoked cheese fries and I have asked for it again, as it should be, but this time I noticed something different: in addition to having little pork (compared to other times in other fosters) I also noticed different cheese and also there was little. Also, with my sandwich they brought me normal fried √±atatas instead of the dipper as it should be normal since I did not ask for any change. I do not know if it is a matter of this specific fosters (since it is the first time I come) or things have changed during the pandemic (since the last time I went to a foster was 5 months ago) but it has disappointed me a bit, That's why those 4 stars and not the 5. I hope they have not changed the ingredients or the recipe of my pulled smoked cheese fries because I adore it haha ‚Äã‚Äãand I hope that next time they can serve it to me as it should be. Still the service was very friendly and fast and the place was very clean to have so many people eating so 4 stars deserved ^^.I have returned and it has improved a lot, I have also tried the black label burger and it is spectacular. I keep saying that the service is super attentive and friendly, it's well worth it\n",
      "Food with normal taste. Reasonable beneficial cost. Negative point that in the place we stayed the floor was dirty and the men's bathroom was not very clean either. Informing that I make these observations about the cleaning because we entered the restaurant as soon as it opened. So, I wouldn't justify the floor and the bathroom being very poorly cleaned.\n",
      "Normal, I do not know if due to lack of staff or lack of desire, very slow and without anything special to highlight.\n",
      "Good afternoon, beautiful people on the internet, I must inform you that never in my life have they given me such bad service, they waited an approximate hour and a half, to top it off they forgot to bring a plate ... also the plate was very basic for the cost . Responding to what the local said: that dish never arrived. On the other hand, the ribs did not have enough sauce, the portion of potatoes was small and without salt nor did they offer us ketchup, coffee, or desserts ... although we did not want them either.\n",
      "The rich and abundant food\n",
      "Powerful and very tender ribs\n",
      "Delicious food, the best dish the bacon cheese fries !!\n",
      "Good food as always\n",
      "We loved it!!! Original and tasteful decoration, very abundant and very good dishes, and all the staff very attentive and friendly ... we will repeat !!! üçîüçüüßÄüçîüòãüòãüòã\n",
      "The food and the attention were perfect, but they have some very low lamps. I hit my head hard with one and our waiter, who saw it, didn't even care about it\n",
      "Good food and desserts at a moderate price. On weekdays there is less that is not bad at all.\n",
      "They have been very kind, and once they have served us, the food has not been long in coming.I recommend it.\n",
      "My experience has been very good, the attention was very friendly and very fast, the food was excellent and it is a good American-style restaurant, if you become a Fosterian they will give you discounts, I visit it on Halloween and it was very well decorated\n",
      "We have tried menu and a la carte, it should be noted that they are quite considerable portions and the price is correct !!I would say that as a negative point perhaps the bathroom lacks some reform, compared to the whole restaurant which is very nice and new.To have tapas with friends and have a good time I recommend the friendly waiters and the speed they have in serving is brutal !!We will keep coming back.\n",
      "A change that gives me a ticket like that, I ask the waiter to make a change but I should go to the bar to do it ... I think it's great!\n",
      "Galician restaurant, the menu is approximately 12.50. It has a variety of dishes, good raw materials, a large terrace. We ate on the terrace, the service was excellent, fast and attentive. The food was very good, rice with flavor and at its point, the right salad and gazpacho.Correct measures against covid by the staff but inside the tables are very close and it was full.Otherwise everything is great.\n",
      "Good site\n",
      "I made a menu of the day and the value for money of the best I usually find.Despite being very crowded, the service is very attentive and fast.\n",
      "I went to eat with a friend on Three Kings day and the food was very good with a taste of home cooking.\n",
      "Regular service. The food nothing to write home about. The coca bread was not brought right before the desserts, after claiming it twice. It had been recommended to me, but I do not recommend it to anyone. And it is the first time that I make an unfavorable review about a restaurant that I have been to.\n",
      "Very rich food, very generous quantities and the perfect price.I have gone a couple of times to eat a menu and both times I really liked the food.The menu has a variety of dishes.\n",
      "Good portions, homemade food and quality products, which gives a correct quality price. The service is usually fast although sometimes they get a bit confused. More than recommended place.\n",
      "Good quality Galician tapas. Indoor and terrace service. A Galician treat at a good price.\n",
      "I lost my attention a bit. Still very good!\n",
      "Very good everything and good price, highly recommended\n",
      "The food was very tasty and cheap, the staff was very attentive, complying with the security measures due to the current situation, we were 7 people and they sat us at 2 tables. Highly recommended\n",
      "One last. All delicious. Great daily menu.\n",
      "We ate some tapas and it was quite good except for the Galician octopus portion which was tiny, but not the price. If you don't ask for octopus, fine.Regarding the cleaning of the terrace tables, I did not see any measure to disinfect them, in addition to being too close to each other.\n",
      "Wrong. Very expensive for such poor quality. A small portion of octopus at the fair x just over 17 euros. And the service of the waiters very poor ... Not to return, a shame.\n",
      "Very friendly staff, fast and good service, but a very poor and outdated menu, terrible quality, even the salads leave something to be desired. It is not a place that I would recommend eating to anyone.\n",
      "All very good and very good customer service\n",
      "Generous dishes great value for money and service, attention and kindness of 10 !!! I recommend it\n",
      "We have come many times but like today, none. Table of 7 and a high chair (a table of 4 and another of 3 with the high chair). We initially asked for a sole for the girl so that they could bring it as soon as possible and thank goodness we asked for it first, since it has come 45 minutes later telling every 5 minutes that it was for the girl. The tapas have come those who have wanted since either they left things like glass bread with the ham or they forgot to bring a lid. The deal with the waiter has been correct but the waiting times have been disastrous‚Ä¶. We do not know what happened but today is very bad.\n",
      "The site well, everything fast and good.The bill is quite correct, four egg whites, which came with a lid, some patatas bravas, a coke and a natural juice for 19-something euros.What has left me quite unsettled is that they allow a group of clients, who seemed regulars, to be at the bar blocking the entrance, and another one of them smoking.If it weren't for the COVID, and why he was smoking, I wouldn't have given it more importance.\n",
      "Food is ok.They take a long time to serve. Little organization, both outside and inside the kitchen.I remember, they were very good and effective a long time ago.\n",
      "It is quite well priced and regarding tapas it has a lot of variety although for my taste they are quite normal, the only tapas that I recommend 100% are cod fritters. For my personal taste I did not like the bravas since it is not a mixture of bravas, it is tomato with aioli.\n",
      "Whenever we come to Mux√≠a we eat very well and have a good time. Good service, good price and quality. Tip for the sweet tooth: leave a hole for dessert üòã\n",
      "You eat well and very good treatment from the guys who have attended us we will return\n",
      "Spectacular food, unrivaled menus. The quality / price very good.Fast service and proper attention.Great variety of meats, fish, wines, etc .....If you don't want to stay on the street you better book, complicated parking, but you have a metro stop next door (L9 Proven√ßana).\n",
      "Very good food\n",
      "You don't sit down to have a drink on the terrace, armed robbery, the only thing that is saved are the waiters who were attentive at all times.\n",
      "Normal high prices in some games. Extraordinary team of waiters and kitchen, led by a manager or owner who also has to give it a ten. I have a warehouse that I have to visit frequently and they will have me as a sure customer.\n",
      "The food was passable, I didn't like the rice, the pork shoulder was good but what has left me freezing is that my father has found a piece of metal on the plate, I suppose it was a piece from the fryer that if he gets it swallow we ended up in the ER and not an apology !! To hallucinate !! Because my 2-year-old son was there and I didn't want to ride the chicken.\n",
      "One of the best places for lunch in the neighborhood (\"forquilla lunch\").Every morning you will find a snack and a dish of the day in promotion at a very good price. If you stumble upon a plate of corns, do not hesitate and do not miss it ... impressive !!!At noon you will find menu and in the evenings a la carte portions.Another hidden treasure is the authentic desserts Pity that the coffee is not up to par ....\n",
      "In general, very good and very rich, for a change we asked for snails too and they were not to the liking, they were not very clean. For the rest all good ...\n",
      "Very good quality in all the products and great dishes. A restaurant with many years of experience and excellent dishes\n",
      "Restaurant with terrace. Very tasty food. Menu x almost ‚Ç¨ 12. They have a lot of customers and a lot of waiters. And it has a few minutes from the Mercadona parking. You park, eat, shop and go.\n",
      "Excellent service and great breakfasts, our holidays, it is our ideal place\n",
      "Very good value for money. Perfect for coming to lunch every day.\n",
      "I'm sorry to say that the experience has been very bad ... the food has been bad ... cold ... and with nothing to highlight in its preparation.\n",
      "Excellent. Top site, fantastic staff and management of 10. One of the best places to eat in all of Hospitalet.\n",
      "Restaurate spacious clean good service very good food Highly recommended, whenever I go I am looking forward to returningüëå\n",
      "Excellent cooking. Great variety both in dishes and tapas. Agile, efficient and friendly service. Very good price for the quality they offer. You can not ask for more. If you go, repeat. Sure.\n",
      "First and foremost so I will return attention. From the manager who received us, the owner and all employees. Sunday full and quite agility in attention. We started with a Muxia salad and a bottle of Albari√±o that was good enough to give it to us first to try. When the rice with lobster came, it was already tremendous. Summarizing EXCELLENT\n",
      "Excellent menu offer, dishes with good quantity and quality, very reasonable price, only the dessert was very scarce, I ordered cheese cake and cut it so thin that it crumbled ... For the fantastic rest. highly recommended Good attention by the staff.\n",
      "Good service, cozy, good menu and a la carte, varied, go with time to park.\n",
      "Very good food, very good professionals and the owner great host ... Thank you, we will be back\n",
      "Very good food and you eat it at a good price and good treatment recommended !!!\n",
      "A 10 for the food and a 20 for the boss and all the staff! Everything perfect every time we go! Thanks for everything!\n",
      "Quick and polite service. Servings are large and good for sharing\n",
      "Generous and quality menu at an incredible price.Fast and professional service 100% recommended.I will repeat without a doubt.\n",
      "Excellent, quality food! An unbeatable deal! üëèüèº I was going every month / 2 weeks as a child, for 5.6 or more years haha ‚Äã‚ÄãI already lost count since I have not been able to go to live far for a long timeüíó Wishing to go again! All 10/10\n",
      "Unbeatable food, excellent treatment, they are very fast even with the restaurant always full. I totally recommend this place, it is delicious anything you taste, both sweet and salty. During the week there are menus at a great price since the quality is also incredible. You have to come and try ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç\n",
      "expensive for what I have eatenor\n",
      "very good\n",
      "Good place, cozy, good treatment by the workers and good quality of products\n",
      "Good value for money, very friendly\n",
      "Spectacular attention, nothing to do with the other muxia on Carrilet avenue, one hundred percent recommended, 4 adults had dinner and were totally satisfied\n",
      "The food was quite expensive, the service was slow, as the waiters were taking care of all the tables and they took a long time to attend, perhaps lack of organization\n",
      "Homemade and very good food, great warm price ... Highly recommended !!!\n",
      "Excellent seafood and rice soup, very pleasant attention from the waiters at Aprestadora\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "I personally, always good. A greeted.\n",
      "The food very good, but the wait is to improve. We have already had to wait many times for a dish that did not arrive. I blame it more on the little control the waiters have over the clientele. In addition, it is a problem of organization of the restaurant. With a good manager this would not happen. The last one was that we went in for lunch at 2:30 p.m. and left at 5:30 p.m., a lot. We have not been going for this reason for months, always the same.The prices are adequate.\n",
      "I have eaten from menu and √† la carte several times and it does not disappoint, the portions are generous, the staff very friendly and the place very well decorated\n",
      "Galician of reference in hospitalet. Of the various places they have, this is the most spacious and welcoming. Very friendly waitresses and high quality food. To highlight its paellas and its rice with lobster. The dessert tarts are a fantasy. Very good quality / price option\n",
      "The price of the menu is incredible for the quality of the food they give. One of the best restaurants with the food of a lifetime. Brutal\n",
      "Very good food. Very good service. Totally recommendable\n",
      "Recommended 100x 100 quality price, daily menu 10 euros hearty dishes. Fast service waiters very attentive I recommend it.\n",
      "The food is excellent and the portions are good but ... there is a problem with the service, the man at the entrance gets annoyed when he has to make space for a baby carriage, we also recently had a rude waiter, he forgot the dishes, he wrote the orders wrong and gave us the feeling that he blamed us ... Disappointing ... a shame because there are also very professional and attentive people working, but lately it seems that it can touch a day of good luck and a day bad ...\n",
      "I just stopped for a sandwich but it looks very good and the sandwich was huge, nice treatment, I can't say more !!\n",

      "Galician restaurant, adequate quality-price. Pleasant atmosphere.\n",
      "Great place to eat ... They put a lot and the food is very good ... The only thing that the service is very above you ... I think they have to give people a little more margin to eat with the tranquility that need!\n",
      "I have been there several times. The food is very tasty, and the waiters are friendly and attentive\n",
      "Today bad service they have almost nothing for 40 minutes to bring us a sea bass, they brought us the glass bread almost at the end of dinner, as long ago it was exemplary, today we are very disappointed\n",
      "All delicious\n",
      "I went looking for Galician soup. I didn't ask if there was on the phone, and there wasn't. Mea culpa. The food is correct on an inexpensive menu. The place and the terrace were very full. I don't think the COVID percentage was met. Other than that, very friendly and fast staff.\n",
      "In the middle of a pandemic, it does not respect the capacity, the distance between tables, the number of diners, or anything in its interior room !!! As for the fatal service, we had to ask for bread three times, to ask for more tapas we had almost to approach another waitress who was passing by, and regarding the food we liked the nose (which was acceptable) the bland squid, the sausages the tiny cover, the acceptable but cold potatoes and the croquettes were itchy (I think they were in bad shape).\n",
      "The best food, service and attention.I will return they are lovely.\n",
      "Galician tapas bar near Europe and fira and the entire Fira de Hospitalet complex. Very good tapas, especially seafood, Galician octopus is the star dish of Muxia 2 (The 2 is for being the second place of the owners, the other is located in Hospitalet center next to Carrilet Avenue). Recommended to eat some good tapas accompanied by a very cold Galicia star. To \"improve\", the amount of the rations, are now much smaller than before and if there is football it is difficult to have a conversation inside the premises, but you can always watch the game of Bar√ßa, Madrid or Deportivo. Recommendable.\n",
      "There is a good quality price relation\n",
      "Very good food and attention.\n",

      "The best restaurant for meService a 10The spectacular food üòãVery kind and friendly staff\n",
      "very full\n",
      "We booked for a company Christmas dinner 24 person ‚Ç¨ 29 x person and ... a total disaster, we had to help place the tables they put us apart we ate with our backs to each other, dinner was at 9 o'clock and we started almost at 10 o'clock .Misery rations and simple patatas bravas, for four people ... well and let's not talk about the Iberian ham, I saw it cut twice for someone who was having dinner, they took it out dry and a triangle of cheese for each one. Sea bass, puffff and desserts, well, not a trace of thanks, very arrogant boss. This way you don't win customers. Painful. And this is called a Galician restaurant, I have paid less and I have eaten twice as much in others.\n",
      "Very good human team, very good cooks, a well-kept and well-located place.One of the treasures of Barcelona ..., and I may have fallen short.It is certainly first on the list of options, when choosing.Yes indeed,Call to reserve a table before!\n",
      "Good service and very good quality a wonder to go to lunch or dinner with friends and family\n",
      "Very poor service, good tapas, second courses much to improve.A pity, for now if they do not improve the service, and the kitchen pays more attention to the dishes, it is a restaurant not to return.\n",
      "Large quantities and very good quality. Price about ‚Ç¨ 20-25. I repeat for sure\n",
      "They told me that he ate well. A clean and cozy place but very badly soundproofed. Upon entering and seeing the kitchen we already knew that it would not work out. We were a group of more than 40 people, including several chefs and experts in hospitality and banquets. Appetizer very poor and not very slow, very slow. More than 30 minutes of waiting between dish and fatal dish, although the 2nd was good, fish, when one had finished others had not yet begun. For ‚Ç¨ 26 that cost, those of us who know the sector, everything is very bad, I am sorry, and I do not suspend it because they tell me acquaintances of the guild that eats well, but is not prepared to give group meals without putting more room staff Let each one know his turns.\n",
      "The waiter was a bit scattered ... so to speak. Slow service, the cuttlefish seem to have been fried in cold oil and the salsa of the patatas bravas was repeated the rest of the night.\n",
      "Very good tapas, spacious place, very good service\n",
      "I have eaten wonderfully !!!Very attentive staffI will come back for sure\n",
      "Good food very good price and everything very correct\n",
      "It's fine but the waiters arguing among themselves who does one thing and the other and if they move you from one table to another, one puts you in one place and another comes and then changes you between them and they discuss each other.\n",
      "Good food and good treatment.Simply spectacular meat, varied desserts, generous portions.If you are a meat lover, do not forget to try the Galician beef cutlet or the sirloin.100% recommendable.\n",
      "We ordered the menu. ‚Ç¨ 10 including dessert.The Galician broth was delicious and the second veal changed.Lots of atmosphere and well decorated premises\n",
      "Good attention and good food\n",
      "Food flavor very fresh all over .. The attention of the staff is excellent.\n",
      "I have put myself to the eyelashes, what a blowout of wine and food at an affordable price, a pity that I was surrounded by sweaty and tattooed men, (my companions).Luckily the waitresses are nice.I recommend it\n",
      "You eat very well, generous portions and a friendly treatment.Recommendable!!!\n",
      "Very loose attention and service.Sorry to make this review in a negative light because of the experience we had a few days ago.We went there with a friend who is a vegetarian.And in this restaurant there is almost no offer / no vegetarian dishes.This today, in the middle of the 21st century, is an inconvenience for the restaurant considering that there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian people. And you may lose those potential customersIt would be nice for them to keep that in mind.When he told the waiter what he had for a vegetarian, the response was quite unfortunate: \"if you want I'll make you an omelette.\" Please!! What little creativity or flexibility. My friend was frustrated and said that for an omelet he was not going to a restaurant, he would make it himself at home.And some saut√©ed vegetables or some slightly more solid option than an omelette or salad?\n",
      "Given the characteristics of this restaurant with very adjusted prices, it would have to have more staff, since the wait to receive the order at the table is quite slow, the dishes are considerable and the service is correct.\n",
      "I have been once or twice it is not bad but it is not my favorite place.Let it be clear from my point of view.\n",
      "Spectacular food. Everything we try is always great. For me it is the best restaurant in the area.\n",
      "It is no longer what it was unfortunately ... the waiters very attentive ... but the food ... special mention of the squids that looked like a mixture of gum with oil ...A shame...\n",
      "Pleasant space of tranquility on the terrace. Great service.The delicacy of silence is appreciated to take a few minutes of a fun meal. Accompanying good security measures Covid19\n",
      "Oasis in the center of Barcelona where you can eat great at an adequate price. Everything was delicious. The attention from our waitress was not very correct, that is why I give it 4‚≠êÔ∏è. The price per person was ‚Ç¨ 30.\n",
      "Excessive price for the gastronomic quality. Without bread, 2 glasses of wine and a clear one, with 2 starters and a plate for each of the 3 diners and only 1 dessert, we have come out at 29 euros per person. Super fair amounts, no matter how well located the restaurant is, I do not recommend it ... There are infinite better and cheaper options, and the fact that they do not have a menu does not help to encourage your visit.\n",
      "Classic restaurant, to go to lunch or dinner with friends. Very good and diverse international food. Highly recommended. The waiters are usually very friendly.\n",
      "Marvelous! An iconic restaurant in Barcelona with luxurious architecture. Super fast and professional service, the tapas are a one-way trip and the treatment of the staff is unbeatable, you feel at home. There are vegetarian options, few but good, I highly recommend the Buthan Potatoes and the fresh truffled Tagliolini. My friends said that Ceviche, Burrata and Dumplings are the best in Barcelona. Very good wines and the OH MY GOSH Cheescake. We will always return!\n",
      "A very convivial and original environment, a spectacular service from the waiters and dishes with an authentic and delicate flavor! I have had a pleasant and fun time.\n",
      "The food is good but the portions ridiculously small for the price they charge you.The service could be greatly improved and the space did not respect anti covid measures. The waiters wore the mask under their noses and those at the next table walked around the place without a mask and no one in the restaurant told them anything.I will not be going back, it is a shame because the place is very nice, but not so much as to put the prices they put.\n",
      "Very nice and quiet place to eat. Good presentation of the dishes, everything delicious, the portions are good, with a plate and a couple of starters you are satisfied. The Iberian ham croquettes and squid, excellent. I recommend trying the cheesecake, it is soft and delicious.\n",
      "Great Restaurant where you can be at ease. Good value for money in one of the best streets in Barcelona.\n",
      "We really liked the site. Good service, fast, dishes with taste.The carpaccio and the aubergine were lacking in salt to be able to enjoy all their flavor.The ceviche ok but it is not their specialty, in my opinion.The duck was delicious, the artichokes were ok and I would not order them again, perhaps cooked in another way they would have gained in flavor. The potatoes we loved.In summary, a good experience with pleasant atmosphere, a nice restaurant, fresh ingredients and not heavy food.We will be back to try more dishes and repeat some!\n",
      "Varied menu and attention at all times, prices in accordance with the quality of the dishes. recommendable\n",
      "advised by French friends we went there without a priori. good surprise ! an astonishing menu of Lebanese hummus with peking duck we were pleasantly surprised and for a fair price. nice neighborhood! good address we will come back without hesitation! the service and cocktails were perfect!\n",
      "@restaurantsinbcnMediterranean menu with a product and some classy dishes. All great, we will repeat!\n",
      "Restaurant with a very good location. Located between Paseo de Gracia and Rambla Catalu√±a, near the Diagonal metro stop (L5) or the Proven√ßa railway station.The decoration of the restaurant is one of the most positive things, it transmits a lot of tranquility. The quality of the food is very good, I loved the Mordisco-style patatas bravas, and the ham croquettes were very good. The price is quite reasonable, maybe they could put a little more quantity in some dishes.If it is true that the measures against Covid-19 were not entirely strict, there was not the separation that should exist between table and table. That is why my score is 4 out of 5. I will return without a doubt.\n",
      "Very good and fast service.The chicken was juicy and tender.Sauces good. I would have liked a little more spice in the curry.The roast potatoes were the weak point. A little hard and very thin.\n",
      "Very good and fast service.The rotisserie chicken was juicy and just right. Dads a bit tough.The curry sauce very good, I would have liked it with a bit more heat.\n",
      "A group of young people run this fast food store and the chicken is the main one. They do it pretty well, they‚Äôre fast, even though it‚Äôs a little expensive. Good chicken and croquettes even better. Maybe we'll try more!\n",
      "Excellent gastronomic proposal with chicken as the protagonist. Delicious croquettes, fried chicken strips and hamburgers. The fries are accompanied with Japanese mayonnaise and they are really good. Special mention is made of the simple but delicious tomato salad. We will return for the chicken a l'ast and to enjoy the attention of the waitresses, very professional and pleasant. Totally recommended.\n",
      "The best chicken a l'ast I have eaten in Barcelona. It is a pleasure that you arrive at a place where they do not know you, that it is full but that they make room for you to eat quickly, that is called professionalism.Seeing Greta move (I asked her for her name to publish it) between the tables and organizing is a spectacle.Thanks for your attitude.\n",
      "Incredible a different species unbeatable service very helpful waiters and speaking different languages\n",
      "We ordered and took away a chicken with potatoes - great! Very kind staff spoke English or Italian! All anti Covid-19 rules respected.\n",
      "We went to pick up our order and were queuing waiting our turn to be attended to. Suddenly, an old man slipped in and we politely told him we were queuing up waiting for our turn. To this, he replied that he was in charge and we answered that too. All offended, he replied: \"good good apart, I'm the owner.\" We replied that we liked it very much but that we were also waiting. After this answer, the gentleman continued to comment with sarcasm and irony towards us. We have always had a very good experience with A Pluma in terms of its service and the quality of the food but we find it unfortunate that someone who calls himself \"the owner\" treats his customers like that.\n",
      "Great value for money. The cover usually costs us 13-16 euros, something rare in Barcelona. The best without a doubt is the grilled chicken, they serve you a good amount and it is spectacular. Pineapple is highly recommended for dessert, it is served with a lime syrup and a kind of grained sugar. Healthy and well priced, you can't ask for more.\n",
      "The opinion of the 5 people who have eaten the order:Chicken, croquettes, potatoesWe agree that we liked the croquettes.The chicken and potatoes have totally disappointed us (used to eating chicken a l 'ast and from different places): we have found this one between a raw and at the same time dry, without a marked or defined flavor, bland.We will not repeat, the staging of the premises implies much more than what it offers, the price if it were an innovative product, different, positive, nothing to say, but it is not ...\n",
      "I really wanted to visit this place, I was very excited to see the authentic chicken alast with one of the two sauces that for me are one of the best; Mole Poblano and massaman curry. The eggplant also had miso sauce. You automatically realize that there is a combination of cultures and knowledge. The chicken was soft and mellow and the croquettes were wonderful as well as the corn on the cob, it was like eating popcorn it had an unbeatable flavor do yourself a favor and visit the restaurant ... it may be that people find increases in costs but there really is a knowledge and quality, the attention was very good we will return to try the burger.\n",
      "Ideal for a quick lunch. I don't know which is better, if the tomato, the aubergine with miso, the chicken in sauces (red curry or mole) or ... the pineapple! What a pineapple! #friedchicken\n",
      "Everything is excellent! From the aubergine with miso sauce that we ordered as a starter that has a smoky flavor that goes through a sweet taste and slight acid touches to the chicken curry that is a delight and with just the right touch of spice.Going to the bathroom is quite a cultural walk, I thought the exhibition of very peculiar paintings that they have was great. The attention is very good and they are attentive to all the details all the time. We will be back and without a doubt a restaurant to take friends and family to meet!\n",
      "The waiting time with reservation and order paid was 15min and 2min in 2 days. They seem to prioritize riders and equalize people without reservation. If despite having to pay and book you have to be in line, or wait when there aren‚Äôt any, it‚Äôs not a * premium * experience as they claim to be.\n",
      "Everything perfect, the chicken, the croquettes, the sauces ... the attention and speed of the service. Totally recommendable.\n",
      "Different flavor I likedKindness üëçSalu2\n",
      "Local well decorated and used.The right and kind attention.Tomato salad very good.Fried chicken very well, served in cones and with fries (rich).Mayonnaise with kimchi recommended.\n",
      "I went for the pineapple and it was what I liked the most, the super rich chicken and the potatoes too. But if you go you have to ask for the pineapple and guess its ingredients.\n",
      "Today we have ordered to take away 1 whole chicken, fried chicken and croquettes, we have done it on the web.The attention when arriving to the order very well, everything is very well organized.The chicken was very good and juicy, including the breasts. The potatoes, both roasted and fried, very good. The fried chicken and the hash browns were also very good. The sauces, allioli and kimchi a good complement.\n",
      "Great chicken and the attention received üòâ.Recommendation call to reserve.\n",
      "Excellent food.Unbeatable value for money (5 chicken croquettes ‚Ç¨ 7, but they are very worth it)The staff is fast and very attentive and friendly.\n",
      "Chicken croquettes and roasted chicken variations are delicious. There is also a kind of eggplant miso dengaku, and it is suitable for Japanese people.\n",
      "Excellent quality and service. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Delicious! The best place to eat chicken! Magali attended us and the service was incredible, the atmosphere was very pleasant.\n",
      "Simple dishes of roast chicken, but the simple thing they do well. Chicken for nothing dry (which is common in roast chicken), made with charcoal, and with the possibility of accompanying it with two sauces, which are quite good. The croquette is exceptional, a rich bechamel wrapped in a thin batter. Potatoes also very good.\n",
      "The site is small and needs a reservation because they are full. The great food and especially that intense red tomato as its flavor .. To repeat ...\n",
      "A tasty roast chicken with varied sauces, in a good atmosphere and very attentive waiters.\n",
      "100% recommended, the chicken is fine, but the croquettes and the cannelloni spectacular! Very good attention\n",
      "Insuperable! It is the home of baked chicken. Nice and simple place with a very attentive service. The must of the letter is really all ‚ò∫Ô∏è. The spectacular tomato salad, miso eggplant is great. Delicious croquettes, fried chicken slightly spicy very rich. The spicy wings are spectacular. Baked chicken definitely the best. The cannelloni with bechamel is very rich.The wine selection a 10Desserts without mandatoryThis is the first time I go, this time we were attended by 9. Experience 10, we return for sure\n",
      "We ordered from the web. Apparently they don‚Äôt coordinate it well enough because they didn‚Äôt have much record of it and I guess that‚Äôs why I had to wait a while to pick it up. Also, I had ordered fried chicken for my little son but they put it spicy and he couldn‚Äôt eat it, of course. For all this, my recommendation is not to order through the web.On the other hand, chicken is nothing out of this world. In fact, it is rather dry. The fried one, on the other hand, is good enough as well as the french fries and sauces to accompany which I would highlight the garlic-and-oil and the curry.I don‚Äôt think we repeat. I will not advertise other houses but for this price there are much better ones.\n",
      "The chicken is very good. All right\n",
      "The best chickens that I have eaten, and I have eaten many, tasty, juicy, it was a delivery service, the wep gives you many options and the delivery service was very punctual and very correct. One hundred percent recommended.\n",
      "I did not like it !!! All lies, the chicken is not wood-fired !!! It is no wonder ... quality very low price !!!\n",
      "I had wanted to visit this site for a long time.We ordered to take a chicken and some chicken nuggets.The brutal chicken is served with potatoes that capture all the flavor of the very good chicken.The creamy croquettes, excellent.No complaint, I'll be back to try new things.\n",
      "Very good and very pleasant on the terrace.\n",
      "IT IS ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO EAT AT APLUMA !!!! THE QUALITY AND SERVICE ARE UNBEATABLE !!!I RECOMMEND IT!!!!\n",
      "It would not be a place I would return to. Previously I had gone several times to the one on Santal√≥ street, so I liked the chicken much more. The tomato salads were very good, somewhat short for their price. The aubergine also good. And the pineapple with lime is fine. But in short, red prawn from Garrucha was not.\n",
      "The chickens are delicious. Is it worth it!!,,\n",
      "Feeling of neglect of the premises. The glasses had worn paint, the place inside looked a bit dirty, to access the toilet you have to skim past the workers who prepare the orders while they work at tables in the middle of the room, the toilet is also quite neglected. The food is nothing to write home about, there is little variety. On the web I saw pita and other dishes and when I got there the menu was very limited. Quite expensive for what it is. I expected much more due to the chef's name: a neat, clean, beautiful place and good food. It was not so.\n",
      "Spectacular, congratulations. Eugeni you are lucky.\n",
      "Quality although at a more than high price ..It is totally worth recommending ... although it can only be ordered to go... busy area ..\n",
      "You can eat only chicken and small dishes. Good service, very friendly and good cuisine\n",
      "Very bad experience with your delivery. I do not recommend it.\n",
      "I've only had chicken but it's delicious\n",
      "Excellent! This site is worth it. Really impressed with the quality and service. 100% recommendable. One of the best crispy chickens I've had in recent times. At an affordable price. They just found a new regular customer. Bravo! üëèüèº\n",

      "Chicken very good.\n",
      "Fried chicken is a 10\n",
      "Through the Comidista they said it was the best chicken al'ast in Barcelona. I do not dare to confirm that it is like that but, without a doubt, one of the best. In addition, the attention of the staff is sensational\n",
      "All based on well cooked chicken. The exquisite bread, the detail of toasting is appreciated. I think it doesn't have a closed-price menu, which would be nice. In general you eat well.\n",
      "Excellent, delicious.All of 10, in my opinion only the hanburger out of tune\n",
      "Great food! As in all APluma !! Does not failJust this last time the somewhat fair staff (one in particular) had a reservation and even so we had to eat 3 at a table of 2 quite fair ... but the previous times both the attention and the food were very good.Recommendable!!\n",
      "Spectacular that with such a simple product that is chicken, everything is so good. The burgers with their potatoes, the croquettes and the cannelloni all very tasty !!!\n",
      "VERY tasty food\n",
      "Eat a chicken at AST, eat something more glamor. Good starters, simple, but appetizing, including the tomato salad ..... A delight.\n",
      "Good chicken, good portions of potatoes, insufficient sauce. Good prices still.\n",
      "The first time we go to this establishment in Gracia.Nothing to object with the organization and service, a ten for this section.Two stars for the chicken croquettes, the quality of these with the price I find it exorbitant, 6 croquettes are worth more than half a chicken.The correct chicken but with a chicken like the one we have had, 4 people do not eat.In short, correct service, but expensive prices for what they offer, good quality except for the croquettes, both for their quality and price.The all i smelled very good but a tiny terrine and a ridiculous portion of potatoes,Barcelonians, there are alternatives to this place, perhaps if the price were more moderate, it would put 5 stars.\n",
      "Everything they have is good. Highlights include fried chicken and croquettes. Tomato, pepper, eggplant miso of very good quality, whenever I come I order any of the three. The treatment is very good and at a very good price.\n",
      "The best chicken in Barcelona. Excellent service, very well located premises. Top quality product. Everything they prepare is fantastic.\n",
      "The best rotisserie chicken I've ever had! Good service, friendly staff!\n",
      "Grilled chicken with a sophisticated touch. The presentation of the typical chicken on the spit rises to the level in this place. We tried the chicken and croquettes. Very good all 2 products, I would highlight the quality of the croquettes. Chickens a little expensive, but it's good. Friendly staff in treatment.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "We go every week with those from work. A Pluma is already tradition. The taste of the chicken, the potatoes, the tomato salad ... all amazing!\n",
      "The chicken burgers are of vice and the sauce is already to finish off on the grill!\n",
      "Good attention. Very kind and very diligent. Very well made chickens.\n",
      "Very rich!! We ordered 1 chicken with potatoes and 1 serving of blanched! Juicy and tasty chicken, very tasty potatoes and aioli. There were two of us and we ate quite well, we were more than satisfied, good relation in quantity / quality and price.\n",
      "Very good quality of food\n",
      "Today I placed an order at A Pluma de Santalo and it was a complete success. The chicken as always exquisite the tremendously good croquettes the very well prepared roasted. The treatment and excellent service.They have a gift for people.I recommend it. And I plan to repeat.\n",
      "I will start on the good side, clean looking place .... but that sells chicken with too much oil, it has been repeating to me all afternoon. I will not buy again. Attached oil photo. A pity, I had been excited that they would open a chicken shop like the ones of a lifetime next to where I live.\n",
      "After many recommendations today we were finally able to taste the chicken on the spit of this place: brutal! Amazing ... it‚Äôs perfect, not overcooked but super aromatic and tender, with some delicious baked potatoes ... The escalivada was also delicious. We are sure to be regular customers from now on!\n",
      "All very good, and very good treatment\n",
      "They deliver to all zip codes, 08015, 08017 etc ... except my 08016. Any reason?\n",
      "Food at home: Late and cold, they don't pick up the phone when you call to find out the status of your shipment.\n",
      "Bad expectations,I ordered two chickens to take away and both were raw inside.Dried chicken, the only thing that is saved are the potatoes. It's a shame.I will not ask again. As a positive point, the design of the premises.\n",
      "All the A Plumas in town are amazing. Very good quality food for affordable prices, reduced menu because it is specialized and excellent treatment. I love this place for me there is no other like it in terms of roast chicken in Barcelona :)\n",
      "The best chicken I ate. I went to eat alone, they brought me a tray of chicken, I ate it whole. Then they told me that I had eaten HALF CHICKEN by myself. I recommend the grilled chicken with tomato salad and for dessert the pineapple with \"surprise\" or the nougat ice cream. I would ALWAYS come back.\n",
      "Simple but excellent cuisine. Ideal for a dinner with friends or if you are looking for an informal atmosphere at affordable prices. The tomato salad, the croquettes and the chicken are from traca.\n",
      "What a pleasure to eat the feather food again. Look, I've eaten times and I can't describe what I like the most. By the way I have a delicate stomach and I have never eaten the oily chicken and much less it has made me feel bad.\n",
      "Exquisite food!! We went by recommendation and we were delighted! The chicken is very good, highlighting the tomato salad and the cannelloni, and the service of 10. A real pleasure to eat in such a place, highly recommended.\n",
      "I loved the last chicken, fried chicken burger and the chicken strips and what to say about the excellent service. I would repeat.\n",
      "The chicken is very good and so is the cannelloni\n",
      "I was looking forward to trying it and of course it has not disappointed. Delicious and great potatoes. We will repeat very soon\n",
      "Chicken, croquettes, the cannelloni and the \"super crunchy\" chicken burgerFrom 10üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç\n",
      "Restaurant specialized in chicken. Roast chicken, fried chicken !!!! All delicious, garnished with their amazing kimchi mayonnaise. For starters, it has chicken croquettes ... There is also a roasted chicken cannelloni with b√©chamel that has become essential for me !!!!!! Very good fries, crispy but not burnt. The place has tables in it. Interior, which has not yet opened due to the Pandemic, and a covered terrace, being in the gardens, is very beautiful, no cars pass by. I recommend it 100%, good, nice and cheap. Three glasses of beer, fried chicken that goes with potatoes and kimchi mayonnaise and 3 croquettes ‚Ç¨ 24 !!!!!!I advise to book.\n",
      "Chicken to take it right, but not superior to any other chicken site that is in the neighborhood cheaper and would even say better. I do not recommend it because at that price I expected something more exceptional. It's good and good. Expensive\n",
      "The web does not work ... You place the order, try to pay and it crashes.\n",
      "Restaurant where all your menu is based on an ingredient: the chicken.On one occasion we bought a chicken from the ast to take away (they had accompanying potatoes) and croquettes.On another occasion we drank on the terrace, as we went with a dog. I ordered the chicken cannelloni with apple and foie, it must be said that it was BONISSIM, and without a doubt we will repeat.Surely more than one Sunday we will look for a chicken in the week.We should also emphasize the kindness of all its workers!\n",
      "Big surprise!!! We have arrived almost unintentionally and it has been a successVery good food, well cooked chickens and in general all very goodGreat service, fast, attentive and closeGreat find !!\n",

      "The small but very tasty chicken, the very nice guys good attention\n",
      "Regulate the chicken.\n",
      "The chicken really is very good and the waiters are very friendly. The only criticism would be that they do not have ketchup or normal mayonnaise. They only have Mayonnaise with kimchi and lime and all i oli. Thanks for the service. I recommend it 100%\n",
      "Good chickens\n",
      "Roasted chickens and excellent homemade food. You can also eat on site as well as take away. Highly recommended the tomato salad and the scalded. The service is very friendly.\n",
      "If you like fried chicken, without a doubt this is the place, whenever I go I ask for it super crunchy with that spicy little point that is crazy, and with a tomato salad, you have eaten like a man. We will certainly keep repeating. üòçüòç\n",
      "Very rich chicken and its different sauces. Excellent attention, as well as the prices.\n",
      "The chickens are good but they are small and lacking in sauce. I like the chickens of llul better\n",
      "One of the best chickens I've ever had, the meat literally melts in your mouth. I also recommend the tomatoes. We will repeat for sure.\n",

      "Everything is delicious and very good service!\n",
      "The best fried chicken in the entire city, delicious, super juicy, and without a pinch of oil left over in a perfect fry. Extraordinary cannelloni. The tomato salad ... there is no better tomato Croquettes, which gives the feeling that you put a rustic chicken directly into your mouth. And the chicken in the josper without words.To finish the pineapple for dessert, sublime.I declare myself a fan of this conceptT\n",
      "Here you can taste a good chicken very well prepared with different sauces, including l'ast and fried, and also some starters where the tomato salad is the queen, but there are classics such as croquettes and chicken cannelloni.Recommended the very refreshing pineapple dessert !!!\n",

      "For chicken loversOf the best of Barcelona\n",
      "This new place is super nice and big, and with a terrace! The josper chicken delicious, and the fried too. It is essential to order the cannelloni, the tomato in salad, the eggplant with miso ... and dessert! I love pineapple, I will come back to try more.\n",

      "Excellent everything I tried! one of my favorite places\n",
      "I have repeated several times in the A pen. In several of its premises. Spectacular food, very careful and tasty. The last visit disappointed us a bit since the best dish, the fried chicken, had run out. I think that in a place with such a small and specific menu, that the star dish was finished on a Saturday at 10 PM, it is a point to improve. However the place is very nice and the waiters very attentive. Very good service.\n",

      "Menu of the day at ‚Ç¨ 11. Simple kitchen and average quality. Salads, Cuban rice, croquettes, sausage, fricand√≥, etc. The chips on the menu are frozen. Great service. Normal washbasins. I have not seen entrance adapted for the disabled. You do not have to be a member to enter. It is reached by a pedestrian street 5 minutes walk from the hospital of Vall d'Hebron. It has a nice terrace. There is a little oasis effect in the middle of the city.\n",
      "Without a doubt my favorite place for any event! Nina and her great team have become a great family for which I am super grateful! I have been doing events with them since 2015!

      "The dishes in general are rich. The best are the bravas, which has a very good contrast between the light foam and a spicier sauce in the center. It seems small but it is deceiving; fills up a lot. This dish is really delicious.The low-temperature egg is delicious, although for my taste it lacked something else to dip like a good piece of bread. I found the rice with eel strong in flavor; especially eel.When ordering the desserts we had a new waitress who did not explain to us that the cheese cake has blue cheese and that it is very strong in flavor. I hate blue cheese and strong cheeses in general, so I had a very generous portion and as soon as I felt the flavor so strong and specific, it almost gave me something of how bad it tasted! The taste did not go away no matter how much I drank water. We had ordered at least two desserts and I was able to eat the French toast, which is very tasty. Of course it all depends on the taste of each one; Anyone who likes super strong cheese will love this cheesecake.\n",
      "An ideal place to eat good original tapas, made with a quality product. The attention of the very correct staff and very attentive at all times.The 3 desserts we ordered were delicious, but the torrija one was spectacular.A 100% recommended site.\n",
      "Tapas restaurant by Jordi Cruz. High quality dishes and a very good product. We loved each and every one of the dishes we ordered, we even repeated some.100% recommended to come to eat. Another option is the tasting menu which is brutal.The place is very modern and beautiful, with excellent service.\n",
      "Great dining experience. The dishes were quite good, original and of acceptable quantity. The dessert, 'pink panter', from another world.Perhaps the prices are somewhat high. When I went, the bathrooms weren't very clean, I don't know if this will be usual.\n",
      "Personally it has been a very good experience. We have made the tasting menu and everything was very very tasty. For me, a good price / quality ratio. Apart from the tasting menu, we have taken the tapa of bravas, we wanted to try them. Super recommended !! The pity has been that they have forgotten to wear the petit four ... but hey, that will not lower the score either, it would not be fair\n",
      "Tasting menu of 10. Incredibly friendly staff. Very good experience.\n",
      "Fresh and good quality products, original dishes. The style is tapas, not single-dish, which is just what we wanted. They also have a tasting menu.We loved it and for a more than fair price of ‚Ç¨ 30 / pers. we left full. Good atmosphere also for couples.I recommend the curry and lamb brioix, the dogfish and the cream ninyoyaki.\n",
      "We arrived at the restaurant with high expectations after trying Abac and being followers of Jordi's cuisine.The place is quite simple.Average food ... We didn't find that rock and roll defined.Very basic service, very very basic.And to top it off we had to change tables because of flies ... This left us speechless.A disappointment\n",
      "I chose a tasting menu for my partner's birthday present. She was delighted. It allows you to try Jordi Cruz's cuisine at a reasonable price.\n",
      "Adequate price quality tasting menu. Very attentive table service.\n",
      "Very good tasting menu, exquisite attention, good quality / price ratio.\n",
      "Good service and quality of products. Limited variety and somewhat high prices for the amount they serve. Nice place. Good option if you want to try something by Jordi Cruz.\n",
      "I was with my wife last Thursday. Impressive. We ordered the tasting menu and it was all delicious. We loved the tempo and progression of the dishes. The extraordinary staff. We did not have time to recommend it! We will be back.\n",
      "Rich and well prepared tapas. The very rich dogfish as well as the eel rice. Totally recommendable.\n",
      "All very good, Jordi Cruz does not fail and the attention is very good ... We will repeat.\n",
      "Ufff, very successful, taste and quality, of course attention and cleanliness, remarkable high\n",
      "Regrettable. After booking indicating an allergy to nuts, upon arrival they confirmed that they had the information and asked us extensively the level of the allergy. After this they clearly indicated that the tasting menu would have some change. At the time of the desserts, they served us a dish that luckily we knew and that had almonds among its ingredients. They changed us for a fruit salad with ice cream thanks to the fact that we told them otherwise ... To top it off in the petits fours they again offered us some chocolates with nuts ... This time at least they apologized.\n",
      "Restaurant to discover very elaborate and exquisite tapas, impeccable staff treatment, quiet and pleasant place.We will repeat\n",
      "Affordable price, variety of tapas made with great taste.\n",
      "STAR FOOD AND MCDONALDS SERVICEThe food is spectacular. We ordered several tapas and portions to share. It was all great and not badly priced. That is if the service DEPLORABLE, from Mcdonalds (but at the price of a Restaurant). We ate on the terrace. I list the things we didn't like regarding the service:No tablecloth, no underplate or anything on the table.We were served by 4 different waiters (I have never seen it in this type of restaurant)We ate on the terrace and in the place next door they had loud music, tremendously annoying.The waiters did not stop by the table other than to take orders and bring the food. At no time did they ask us what we were like, nor did they explain anything about the menu, nor did they explain what dish they brought ...We ordered a few tapas and portions to share. First they brought us the oysters, then two tapas (we had ordered 3), and after about 10 minutes they brought us the rest of the dishes (6 in total) all at once. At this moment, a lot of dishes were gathered on the table, without any order or sense since after 5 minutes many of the dishes were cold.In my opinion and that of my companions, all regulars of restaurants of this type, the service and the small details completely spoil the experience, preventing you from enjoying such delicious dishes. We did not understand the concept of \"Restaurant\". I quote it because the service seemed more like a bar to have a few beers with colleagues than a restaurant.The truth is that it is a shame that in a place with such a high level of cuisine, which bears the name of a chef with 3 Michelin stars, they have such seedy service and so little attention is paid to details.\n",
      "Everything was incredible, we made the tasting menu, you can see the stamp of Jordi Cruz. We will be back.\n",
      "A pleasant surprise. Jordi Cruz's stamp is already a guaranteeNice place located in El BornDelicious tasting menu at a great price. Authentic and very efficient service. Young people .\n",
      "Very good. Very attentive service. The tasting menu is perfect, even too much for me .. ü§£ü§£\n",
      "Tomamoa tasting menu, it was good although the two desserts were very similar, the dish stands out, which is an incredible egg, the rest does not seem to me to stand out at all. It was good value for money.\n",
      "I loved it, the Tasting Menu is impressive, everything is great and each dish surprises you.\n",
      "Spectacular tapas, creative cuisine and with a very good attention from all the room staff. It really was a very pleasant visit.\n",
      "Bittersweet feeling after making the tasting menu. Very good dishes, from the first to the last, but in our opinion the service left a lot to be desired. They brought the dishes to the table without giving any explanation. Also, when we were going for dessert, around 4.15pm, all the waiters disappeared from the room, only the girl from the bar (who is in another separate space) remained. We had to get up to order the last dish as no one brought it to us nor did they come to ask if we wanted coffee. When it came to paying we also had to get up to ask where we needed to go. A service little to match a restaurant of this category.\n",
      "Very elaborate tapas cuisine with good service\n",
      "Spectacular! My husband has given me a tasting menu for my 40th birthday and the truth is that I am delighted. The food is good, no, the following, the staff are super attentive and aware that the dishes comply with my dietary restrictions (allergy to nuts). We have loved everything, the mixture of flavors, the explanations and the rhythm at which the dishes are coming out that makes you come out more than satisfied (in my case very full). The place is small but charming. After trying the tasting menu, we will surely repeat some of the tapas that we have eaten today. After trying the food, it is not surprising that Jordi Cruz has 6 Michelin stars.\n",
      "Exquisite tasting menu. I recommend it.\n",
      "The place is very cool decorated, very modern. The way to place your order is through mobile, very practical. The burgers are sooo good, of a good size, maybe a bit done, the brioche bread very soft, with a very good sweet spot. Fries with parmesan very good. We will repeat for sure.\n",
      "A very good quality hamburger restaurant, with a concept somewhat different from the others.The order system is good; however I find it somewhat complex for someone who comes without a mobile or a foreigner without access to data.I think the bar has a chance, since it is not interesting to sit for a long time, however they sell the concept as slow food ... that does not make much sense.Last point, they should consider a children's menu, since the simple hamburger for a child is simply huge to eat. With that, families could also come and not just people without children.I hope the comments serve you and keep cooking good burgers!\n",
      "Pure fat! I liked it a lot, it is one of the best burgers I have eaten in BCN. Especially the BBQ\n",
      "Good hamburger, even better fries and a very cool place, but without a doubt the best thing about Vicio is its marketing and social media management. Very good work from the entire team that is in charge of advertising and social media.\n",
      "Brutal truth, we got the combo of 2 burgers and the combo of 1 and incredibleThe potato servings are large and the dessert is huge (perfectly for 2 people)In my case I caught PREMIUM Truffled Cheeseburger and it was ...... you have to try it;)PS the photos came out like this because of the red neons of the premises. Once inside they explain how to order (take away style)\n",
      "It's worth queuing to get in for a burger.The place is an experience, the kitchen completely in view and the atmosphere, music and everything.Another roll. Worth trying.Very tasty smash burgers and very tender wings.The photos are not the best but it is that with the light of the disco type place I have not gotten better haha.\n",
      "He catches me next to the office, and I had to go. The value for money is very good. The place draws a lot of attention, although there is not much room (if you come with a scooter you can fold it under your seat). You ask through a QR. We made a Couple goals menu with everything truffled: the truffled veggie, the normal truffle, the truffled potatoes and the nutella cheesecake. It was all delicious! The only bad thing is that I did not find out when the order came out and they called me ...\n",
      "Until today I knew what Vice really was. I have passed by and the decoration and the music have caught my attention. I ordered a Pollos Hermanos, and OMG, it's hilarious!\n",
      "A new concept of restaurant and takeaway! We loved it. When we return to Barcelona we will surely return. Please don't stop trying their cheesecake\n",
      "It is not worth a 5, it is worth a 10 and with this I think there is no need to say more. The best Burger in the city (or if I dare say, in Spain) without a doubt. The marketing they do is brutal tmb.My vice of every week üòâ\n",
      "The restaurant is innovative from the start. The way to order is somewhat different: you scan a QR code, order and pay. After 5-10 minutes they call you and deliver your order, you can eat it at the place, which is tiny, or you can take it with you (it is ready to take it). The food is very good, we have tried the original vice and the bbq cheesburger bacon and everything is great, the potatoes are very good too and the dessert has been a very rich but a little cloying oreo tiramissu, for 2 people a dessert is fine. As a recommendation I would say that the bins should be larger since their hole is very small and normally you eat and throw the garbage in the bags (separating to recycle) and then throw everything together.As a detail, these days Aleix is ‚Äã‚Äãout there and is asking people how the food and attention are. All great, a 10.\n",
      "Very cool place, with a lot of personality. Good and fast service. The burger I ate, Vicio's, was good, though maybe a little expensive for what it was. The fries and desserts are very good.\n",
      "The burgers are spectacular as are the potatoes.As for the place, it is not a restaurant to eat with a group if you go with friends. It's more of a local delivery, and if you want to eat there, it has a mega table that you have to share with strangers. Another thing against is that you can only pay by card and orders have to be made on their website.\n",
      "The quantity and quality is very good, the desserts are tremendous.\n",
      "We were in Barcelona for 4 days and we ate VICIO twice. Little more to add.Excellent food in a rogue environment. Unbeatable !!!! Happy Anniversary\n",
      "How Great You Are Aleix. Thank you very much for your work and your team is the best. Thank you for making Life more tasty and happy !!! I recommend everyone to eat the Vice and enjoy it a lot! I will repeat your Burgers and Pizzas !!!! I like very much! Thank you\n",
      "Good pizzas and generous in quantity. The Neapolitan dough better than the Roman for my taste. Like but, one of the pizzas was a bit burnt. The marketing of the box is original and colorful, although of a peculiar vibe.Second order of burgers. They are very tasty\n"

      "We ordered take out and the brutal truffle egg burger.\n",
      "Very good burgers and potatoes, but for the price of the burger should come a serving of potatoes per person as needed. Because it sold a ration to share for two people and was very small, it corresponded to one ration, not two. Correct atmosphere and service.\n",
      "Delicious burgers. You can see the quality of the ingredients and the bread. We tried the originals vice and the bacon and very good. Perhaps the bacon stands out more for its intense flavor and to bring pieces of bacon with the burger.Crispy and hot potatoes despite arriving in delivery.The price is adjusted to the quality of the product you ask for, they are not expensive at all.We will repeat.\n",
      "In a previous review I have commented on the burgers, this time we ordered the pizza, acceptable.I would recommend trying the burgers.Earn points for the packaging, very good.\n",
      "Very good truffle burger, no potatoes ... They were cold, and made a long time ago\n",
      "All very good, but they go overboard with the salt. It is really excessive. If they could lower it considerably, I would put a 5 stars.\n",
      "When it comes to \"cheat meal day\" you have to try new options. The order has arrived properly packaged and on time, a little cold, I have ordered the Satisfyer plus May truffle combo. It has been ok.\n",
      "ONLY ONE GOOD BURGER HAS COME, FOR THE PRICE THAT IS APPEARABLE, WE EXPECTED ANOTHER TYPE OF SERVICE. THE POTATOES WERE VERY SALTY (may be a personal taste)\n",
      "We ordered burgers on the weekend and they were delicious. Without a doubt the best burgers in all of BCN !!!! At home we are all from VICIO! We will repeat for sure! I recommend it 200%\n",
      "Very good burgers, good treatment from employees and spectacular tiramisu! X true better to go without children, because they eat you dessert.\n",
      "Good product, but they must facilitate payment to customers, they only charge via the web\n",
      "Incredible burger place, good price and great fries and hamburger! Besides, the spectacular aftermath.\n",
      "I think the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant is take-out food, because eating there is an overwhelming feeling.Starting with the red light that within two minutes of being there you already want to leave, followed by a song so loud that it invites you to really leave the premises.We asked to clean the table and they came promptly to do so, but they threw all the crumbs on me.We have tried two burgers and there was nothing different or that makes you want to eat again. The potatoes smelled of old oil and went to the trash. The coke was hot (and they didn't have ice) but the beer was cold.To complete, when opening the oreo tiramisu there was a gift long hair :)An experience as remarkable as it is described on the website.\n",
      "Very good taste and quality burgers and potatoes, highly recommended.\n",
      "My life is not the same anymore. I just ordered for GLOVO and it was the best double cheeseburger of my life. That was an AMAZING burger. My life has changed. I still have hope in humanity and nouveau cuisine and burger. Thanks.\n",
      "CRAZY !!!! the best burger I've ever had. It is simple but brutal, it is not because of the hype. We ordered delivery and it arrived perfect, hot and very very very tasty. The hamburger was the cheese burger and the classic potatoes, delicious super crunchy. A thousand points, you can see that they put a lot of effort, the branding is cool!\n",
      "Behind an innovative image that gives high expectations does not disappoint. Spectacular burgers, clean and fast service. The truffle comes off. I give a 10 to the business concept, marketing and food\n",
      "I only asked Casa but UALAAAAA. I‚Äôm not much of a bourgeois either and these are wonderful. Not only do I congratulate the chefs, I also congratulate the marketing team who always manage to enchant me with their ads. And riders deserve a mention too. AWESOME SERVICE, EQUIPMENT and FOOD !! ALEIX is top!\n",
      "The food is very good, in relation to the price perhaps it is a bit expensive. I tried it when I asked for it at Glovo but since the opening of the new place I have not been able to eat there since it is small and you share a table. It is always full and cannot be reserved. It is a pity\n",
      "Good burgers and local mol√≥n. The music a bit loud, but overall good experience.\n",
      "The atmosphere is super nice, the music is great, the host at the door is charming, and the food ... wow! I cannot recommend it more. Those who have given them few stars have a stunted palate or something.\n",
      "The place has a good atmosphere and generally the service is good. Sadly, the burger is outrageously greasy and the bacon fries are lousy. It is more the hype that people have given it ... I do not recommend it\n",
      "All very good\n",
      "I highly recommend!The Burger are more than excellent, we ordered delivery and were very happy with the speed of delivery.The Burger are very high quality, the fries too, really happy to have trusted this restaurant.Go ahead with your eyes closed.\n",
      "Vice hamburger but cold potatoes and wings, it's a shame, because I would give it 5 stars. Keep working\n",
      "The hamburgers are very good, but there is no way they can pick up the phone to change an ingredient (remove sauce). In the end the order arrived with the sauce inside the hamburger, which we did not want.\n",
      "Burger flavor, spectacular. The truffled cheeseburger üñ§Very fast delivery.Normal that so many people like this Good Vice.The nutella cheesecake, good portion, nothing left hahahaDelicious.\n",
      "We placed an order through the Glovo app at 9:00 p.m., with the estimated delivery time of 35-45 minutes. An hour and a half later, they continue to delay the delivery time, the delivery man has been waiting for almost an hour to pick up our order, obviously we canceled the dinner, since there is no telephone number with which to contact the restaurant.\n",
      "I couldn't like it more, the Truffle is spectacular and the potatoes, perfect to accompany it. Very good work, congratulations!\n",
      "You were asking me how is it? Self-service ... price above the attention, you had neither ice nor lemon for a Coca-Cola, there is no attention beyond a delivery window and there are 40 e for two people ... hamburgers ... correct but overrated\n",
      "The place is super Instagrammable, the boys were a love and the burgers were at another level: it does what it promises! The only thing that makes me angry is not living in Barcelona to fall into real vice!\n",
      "It must be delicious because it is always up to the mark. For my taste a little music scandal for dinner and having a somewhat difficult conversation\n",
      "Beautiful but expensive.\n",
      "I placed an order at Glovo that had to go straight to the trash. Inedible because of how salty it was. The potatoes were coated in salt.\n",
      "Hamburger is very good but gave 3 because the fries were bad: burnt and old.As you see in the photo.\n",
      "Best burquers I have tried without a doubt.The truffle leaves its marküî•\n",
      "I bought using glovo. Combo satisfayer and vegan truffle burger. Nothing to write home about when it comes to flavor. I will not ask again.\n",
      "This hamburger restaurant, more oriented to home delivery or collection, has not seemed anything special to me. The place is not designed to be able to eat there and it is not very cozy, although there is a large central table where you can eat, but the chairs are somewhat uncomfortable.The ordering system is not entirely practical and is done from the mobile.The burgers are nothing special, the meat is rather dry and without much flavor. I ordered a BBQ and the barbecue was conspicuous by its absence. As for the potatoes, there is not much praise to be made either, somewhat dry, almost stiff.Those who say they are one of the best burgers in Barcelona really show that they don't know many burger shops in the city ...All this seasoned with certainly high prices for the quality and product they offer. Maybe I had a bad day in the kitchen, but first impressions are very important.From the staff, nothing to complain about, friendly and attentive.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant to order great burgers! Not only that, but the desserts and pizzas are spectacular !! If you want vice, this is your place. If you want to eat really well, this is your place. If you want a much more than personalized treatment, this is your place. Don't hesitate to order your food at home !!\n",
      "Best burger in Barcelona !! Love the vice originals üí´\n",
      "Always a hit, truffle cheeseburger and BBQ my favorites. Even the impressive potatoes.\n",
      "Very good burgers.The fatal wings.The potatoes with parmesan and truffle goodDesserts are worth nothing.In addition, you cannot pay with cash and you have to ask for it through the application, a roll. There is only one large, communal table with stools to sit on. All very uncomfortable.3 burgers2 wings1 potato2 waters2 soft drinks2 dessertsTotal: 53 euros\n",
      "The hamburgers were very good, the breadMax (no sesame. Thanks god!) Truffled potatoes from another world. Being a new place, the process is adjusting little by little. So patience and good chat with friends while you wait.100% quality üôåüèΩüôåüèΩü§òüèΩ\n",
      "Perhaps because it was just starting, it has not been the best experience. The QR issue is a bit of a mess and there was no willingness to help. If not for another client I would not have found out. The burgers good without going overboard. The potatoes a bit soggy. The waiting time in my case was excessive due to the amount of deliveries they receive. You cannot pay in cash. All with a bank card. Hopefully they improve as constructive criticism because I will not repeat in particular...\n",
      "Excellent service and stone oven pizzas. Recommendable.\n",
      "The burger is super good (BBQ chesseburguer), to say one downside is that it took literally 2 minutes to deliver 2 burgers with potatoes and dessert and they were somewhat cold just like the potatoes. It didn't seem freshly made and it's a shame because the flavor was so rich. Another thing that could perhaps be improved was the volume of the music and the type (techno) that I suppose who likes it great but who wants to dine quietly perhaps was excessive. It was like having dinner at the entrance of Pacha Ibiza, although I suppose the workers were motivated by listening to music üòÜ. It will surely give you a second chance.\n",
      "Slow (they give priority to Glovo orders) to order aCombo 30 min wait and then they get the wrong dessert. My burger was soggy overcooked dry my boyfriend was fine he liked it for this I put a star.\n",
      "I have to say that it is probably one of the best hamburgers we have ever tasted, I was afraid that they will arrive cold, but they have arrived more than perfect, in a more than striking bag ... I loved it, we have ordered the combo for two, We have ordered the truffle burgers that are from another world, it is a perfect combination, the super tasty potatoes and the amazing Oreo tiramisu. The packaging is spectacular from start to finish, an experience that we will repeat for sure! Congratulations on the work to the whole team!\n",
      "So far I had only tried a few hamburgers that had left me speechless and they were the \"Goiko\" but the truth is that Vicio's hamburgers are another level, the first time in Barcelona and we could not leave without trying them. Congratulations to Aleix and the entire team because they are going to give a lot to talk about!\n",
      "Please I have given you a good review, let me ask\n",
      "I would give it five stars, for attention, quality, presentation, but I went with my grandson to look for a hamburger for dinner and when we got home, disappointed, they gave us truffle instead of bacon, so I had to prepare a homemade one for him. little üòî\n",
      "Outstanding price-quality ratio. Cheeseburger as a first choice, to die for! Upgradeable potato chips\n",
      "Scandalous. Without a doubt the best burger I have ever eaten in my life. My girlfriend and I have ordered the 'couple goals' combo with two truffle burgers. When we have taken the first bite and the egg has exploded in our mouth we have hallucinated. Special mention for the nutella cheesecake, creamy and absolutely delicious. Fully recommended site if you pass through Barcelona.\n",
      "Incredibly good, it deserves the price you pay. The truffle is irresistible\n",
      "One of the best chicken burgers I've ever had. Very good packaging and very fast delivery, the hamburgers have arrived hot and the potatoes very crispy, to put a mistake, of the 6 wings, 1 raw wine\n",
      "The most horrible thing to eat\n",
      "Punctual and fabulous burgers that make the truth a real vice üòåü§§Thanks for the good treatmentüíñ\n",
      "Amazing burgers. But it is not a very good place to stay to eat there.\n",
      "We placed an order through a digital platform and after a while, Vice called us to inform us that the delivery man had picked up the order but that it had been lost. On the part of Vicio, they very sincerely apologized (taking into account that it was not their fault), they prepared the habmurgers for us again and made an agreement with the platform themselves to send another delivery man. Of course, it planted!ps: they sent us a delicious dessert that we hadn't ordered.Thank you very much Vice !! and all delicious as always;)\n",
      "A place that will surely close soon. They do not accept cash as a means of payment, they do not explain or guide how to order and the prices are not at all competent!\n",
      "Overrated. Much hype for so little chicha.\n",
      "A scandal!We have ordered bbq and truffle. The meat, the bread, the potatoes and the dessert: everything has a distinctive touch. From 10! And also, fast service and as we have collected it there, very good service. We will repeat and recommend it! Bravo ... Congratulations!\n",
      "All amazing. The burgers, the packaging, everything. We will repeat 100% for sure.\n",
      "Even the eggs of loud music all day, until almost midnight and the noise they make. Very bad coexistence, wishing they would leave\n",
      "Very rich burgersü§§\n",
      "The best burger I have eaten in Barcelona. Iberian, Truffled and Cheeseburger are spectacular and my favorites. Tasty fries and desserts (tiramisu and oreo) are VICIOUS.\n",
      "The burgers are incredible but the music so loud is unbearable\n",
      "I ordered Vice, the service was fast, the packaging tremendous, the beastly marketing and the food ... Vice.The fresh vegetables, the greasy meat, the soft bread, the tasty cheese and everything together ... Like hearing Overkill from Motorhead for the first time.It's been a long time since I spent all my nights thinking about the same thing ...Since I asked, I only think about vice, at all times and in all ways.Soon another score with more vice.\n",
      "For me, the best burgers right now in Barcelona! They are tremendous !!! But what makes them even better is the service behind them, always attentive and detailed. The two times we have asked we had problems with the delivery people and in both cases they worried about calling us and fixing it, although it had not been their fault directly. Thanks and congratulations to Aleix, Carlos and the entire team for your spectacular work!\n",
      "Very good packaging, super original, but personally I expected a better taste, a bit bland.\n",
      "Very well coordinated.\n",

      "Very rich burgers at a price a little higher than usual, even so it is worth going to try them, as a tip they come with a lot of potatoes that can be shared perfectly with two!\n",
      "The best burguers in the city!\n",
      "We asked for a glovo as the founder saw that Masterchef won. We ordered 4 different ones to try them all: the vegan one, the chicken one and two with beef. I was pleasantly surprised by the chicken and the vegan ones, but I have to say that as for the veal ones, I have eaten many better ones in other places. The desserts (we ordered two the oreo tiramisu and the nutella cheesecake) are delicious\n",
      "Spectacular burgers and pizzas.\n",
      "I love them, I have tried several empty ones and the truth is that they have put effort into all the packaging so that everything arrives in order and very well, I hope to soon be able to go to eat at the Restaurant and fill myself more with vice. the wings are to die for.\n",
      "We have ordered a bbq and a vice, the hamburgers very good, the order has arrived a little cold and the bread a little oily. Otherwise, it has a lot of flavor.The dessert without a spoon.But recommended!\n",
      "Brutal! The best burgers (and chicken wings) I've ever eaten üòç\n",
      "I have never been given so much pleasure with a meal ...Alexis if you see this review that you know that I leave you, definitely vice if it gives me mine ...\n",
      "Good accommodation, but they treated me 1h30 to serve the order + the delivery time. At peak times they are not enough. I hope they can improve it in the future and that customers can have compensation for it now, that if I left a physical restaurant I would have already left\n",
      "ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ I will be back !! I don t like it, i love it üòç good luck\n",
      "The service was excellent. On the weekend there is a lot of demand but the wait is worth it. We will repeat\n",
      "We ordered burgers, fries, and dessert. By far the best we've had in a long time! The point of the meat is perfect (we chose the vice and the bacon cheeseburger) the crispy and tasty potatoes (they have nothing to do with those offered by other burgers) and the oreo tiramisu is delicious.You can see that behind there is an incredible design work, the packaging materials denote quality and networking is another level! In short, you can see that the work is very well done and that is why although it may seem a bit expensive, if we take into account everything that is behind it, it is a more than fair price! It certainly deserves the fame it has!\n",
      "Just seeing it takes away the desire to eat, not to mention the price of ‚Ç¨ 14 and no differences or the meat.\n",
      "The burger was delicious! I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Through a delivery app, it is the second time I have ordered hamburgers at this establishment and it will not be the last ... since they are ... VICIOUS !!!Congratulations to your team and continue like this üí™\n",
      "The service and packaging is very good. However, I have ordered the truffle burger following recommendations from friends and I have hardly noticed the \"truffle\" flavor. Also, I would recommend putting an option from the point of meat, mine was well cooked. Much to envy of other burger restaurants in Barcelona\n",
      "Excellent service and the best burgers I have ever eaten !!! Not to mention the potatoes ü§§ We will repeat without a doubtüëåüèº\n",
      "The meat of the spectacular hamburger, the bread the same, to put a but the soft and oily potatoes, although you could tell that they were homemade, so I could not and will not ask again, the bacon made pure and charred, nor did it add any taste And the mouthfeel was unpleasant, it's worth it anyway.\n",
      "bad experience, hamburgers and fast food at a gold price!\n",
      "the packaging is fantastic. The service too. But the burgers better\n",
      "Spectacular burger. I will definitely repeat\n",
      "TREMEEENSS! We repeat that I would say el Ga√∫cho!\n",
      "We love Vice! Brutal burgers, tastys, freshyyyyyyyy!\n",
      "One of the best burgers we have ever tasted! Oh, and the fries are amazing!\n",
      "All great, I recommend it without a doubt üòç\n",
      "When you want to realize there is no hamburger left, only remains of the sauce from the mouth. A bit like when they don't remember to warn you;)\n",
      "The place is very cool decorated, very modern. The way to place your order is through mobile, very practical. The burgers are sooo good, of a good size, maybe a bit done, the brioche bread very soft, with a very good sweet spot. Fries with parmesan very good. We will repeat for sure.\n",
      "A very good quality hamburger restaurant, with a concept somewhat different from the others.The order system is good; however I find it somewhat complex for someone who comes without a mobile or a foreigner without access to data.I think the bar has a chance, since it is not interesting to sit for a long time, however they sell the concept as slow food ... that does not make much sense.Last point, they should consider a children's menu, since the simple hamburger for a child is simply huge to eat. With that, families could also come and not just people without children.I hope the comments serve you and keep cooking good burgers!\n",
      "Pure fat! I liked it a lot, it is one of the best burgers I have eaten in BCN. Especially the BBQ\n",
      "Good hamburger, even better fries and a very cool place, but without a doubt the best thing about Vicio is its marketing and social media management. Very good work from the entire team that is in charge of advertising and social media.\n",
      "Brutal truth, we got the combo of 2 burgers and the combo of 1 and incredibleThe potato servings are large and the dessert is huge (perfectly for 2 people)In my case I caught PREMIUM Truffled Cheeseburger and it was ...... you have to try it;)PS the photos came out like this because of the red neons of the premises. Once inside they explain how to order (take away style)\n",
      "It's worth queuing to get in for a burger.The place is an experience, the kitchen completely in view and the atmosphere, music and everything.Another roll. Worth trying.Very tasty smash burgers and very tender wings.The photos are not the best but it is that with the light of the disco type place I have not gotten better haha.\n",
      "He catches me next to the office, and I had to go. The value for money is very good. The place draws a lot of attention, although there is not much room (if you come with a scooter you can fold it under your seat). You ask through a QR. We made a Couple goals menu with everything truffled: the truffled veggie, the normal truffle, the truffled potatoes and the nutella cheesecake. It was all delicious! The only bad thing is that I did not find out when the order came out and they called me ...\n",
      "Until today I knew what Vice really was. I have passed by and the decoration and the music have caught my attention. I ordered a Pollos Hermanos, and OMG, it's hilarious!\n",
      "A new concept of restaurant and takeaway! We loved it. When we return to Barcelona we will surely return. Please don't stop trying their cheesecake\n",
      "It is not worth a 5, it is worth a 10 and with this I think there is no need to say more. The best Burger in the city (or if I dare say, in Spain) without a doubt. The marketing they do is brutal tmb.My vice of every week üòâ\n",
      "The restaurant is innovative from the start. The way to order is somewhat different: you scan a QR code, order and pay. After 5-10 minutes they call you and deliver your order, you can eat it at the place, which is tiny, or you can take it with you (it is ready to take it). The food is very good, we have tried the original vice and the bbq cheesburger bacon and everything is great, the potatoes are very good too and the dessert has been a very rich but a little cloying oreo tiramissu, for 2 people a dessert is fine. As a recommendation I would say that the bins should be larger since their hole is very small and normally you eat and throw the garbage in the bags (separating to recycle) and then throw everything together.As a detail, these days Aleix is ‚Äã‚Äãout there and is asking people how the food and attention are. All great, a 10.\n",
      "Very cool place, with a lot of personality. Good and fast service. The burger I ate, Vicio's, was good, though maybe a little expensive for what it was. The fries and desserts are very good.\n",
      "The burgers are spectacular as are the potatoes.As for the place, it is not a restaurant to eat with a group if you go with friends. It's more of a local delivery, and if you want to eat there, it has a mega table that you have to share with strangers. Another thing against is that you can only pay by card and orders have to be made on their website.\n",
      "The quantity and quality is very good, the desserts are tremendous.\n",
      "We were in Barcelona for 4 days and we ate VICIO twice. Little more to add.Excellent food in a rogue environment. Unbeatable !!!! Happy Anniversary\n",
      "How Great You Are Aleix. Thank you very much for your work and your team is the best. Thank you for making Life more tasty and happy !!! I recommend everyone to eat the Vice and enjoy it a lot! I will repeat your Burgers and Pizzas !!!! I like very much! Thank you\n",
      "Good pizzas and generous in quantity. The Neapolitan dough better than the Roman for my taste. Like but, one of the pizzas was a bit burnt. The marketing of the box is original and colorful, although of a peculiar vibe.Second order of burgers. They are very tasty\n",
      "We ordered take out and the brutal truffle egg burger.\n",
      "Very good burgers and potatoes, but for the price of the burger should come a serving of potatoes per person as needed. Because it sold a ration to share for two people and was very small, it corresponded to one ration, not two. Correct atmosphere and service.\n",

      "My life is not the same anymore. I just ordered for GLOVO and it was the best double cheeseburger of my life. That was an AMAZING burger. My life has changed. I still have hope in humanity and nouveau cuisine and burger. Thanks.\n",
      "CRAZY !!!! the best burger I've ever had. It is simple but brutal, it is not because of the hype. We ordered delivery and it arrived perfect, hot and very very very tasty. The hamburger was the cheese burger and the classic potatoes, delicious super crunchy. A thousand points, you can see that they put a lot of effort, the branding is cool!\n",
      "Behind an innovative image that gives high expectations does not disappoint. Spectacular burgers, clean and fast service. The truffle comes off. I give a 10 to the business concept, marketing and food\n",
      "I only asked Casa but UALAAAAA. I‚Äôm not much of a bourgeois either and these are wonderful. Not only do I congratulate the chefs, I also congratulate the marketing team who always manage to enchant me with their ads. And riders deserve a mention too. AWESOME SERVICE, EQUIPMENT and FOOD !! ALEIX is top!\n",
      "The food is very good, in relation to the price perhaps it is a bit expensive. I tried it when I asked for it at Glovo but since the opening of the new place I have not been able to eat there since it is small and you share a table. It is always full and cannot be reserved. It is a pity\n",
      "Good burgers and local mol√≥n. The music a bit loud, but overall good experience.\n",
      "The atmosphere is super nice, the music is great, the host at the door is charming, and the food ... wow! I cannot recommend it more. Those who have given them few stars have a stunted palate or something.\n",
      "The place has a good atmosphere and generally the service is good. Sadly, the burger is outrageously greasy and the bacon fries are lousy. It is more the hype that people have given it ... I do not recommend it\n",
      "All very good\n",
      "I highly recommend!The Burger are more than excellent, we ordered delivery and were very happy with the speed of delivery.The Burger are very high quality, the fries too, really happy to have trusted this restaurant.Go ahead with your eyes closed.\n",
      "Vice hamburger but cold potatoes and wings, it's a shame, because I would give it 5 stars. Keep working\n",
      "The hamburgers are very good, but there is no way they can pick up the phone to change an ingredient (remove sauce). In the end the order arrived with the sauce inside the hamburger, which we did not want.\n",
      "Burger flavor, spectacular. The truffled cheeseburger üñ§Very fast delivery.Normal that so many people like this Good Vice.The nutella cheesecake, good portion, nothing left hahahaDelicious.\n",
      "We placed an order through the Glovo app at 9:00 p.m., with the estimated delivery time of 35-45 minutes. An hour and a half later, they continue to delay the delivery time, the delivery man has been waiting for almost an hour to pick up our order, obviously we canceled the dinner, since there is no telephone number with which to contact the restaurant.\n",
      "I couldn't like it more, the Truffle is spectacular and the potatoes, perfect to accompany it. Very good work, congratulations!\n",
      "You were asking me how is it? Self-service ... price above the attention, you had neither ice nor lemon for a Coca-Cola, there is no attention beyond a delivery window and there are 40 e for two people ... hamburgers ... correct but overrated\n",
      "The place is super Instagrammable, the boys were a love and the burgers were at another level: it does what it promises! The only thing that makes me angry is not living in Barcelona to fall into real vice!\n",
      "It must be delicious because it is always up to the mark. For my taste a little music scandal for dinner and having a somewhat difficult conversation\n",
      "Beautiful but expensive.\n",
      "I placed an order at Glovo that had to go straight to the trash. Inedible because of how salty it was. The potatoes were coated in salt.\n",
      "Hamburger is very good but gave 3 because the fries were bad: burnt and old.As you see in the photo.\n",
      "Best burquers I have tried without a doubt.The truffle leaves its marküî•\n",
      "I bought using glovo. Combo satisfayer and vegan truffle burger. Nothing to write home about when it comes to flavor. I will not ask again.\n",
      "This hamburger restaurant, more oriented to home delivery or collection, has not seemed anything special to me. The place is not designed to be able to eat there and it is not very cozy, although there is a large central table where you can eat, but the chairs are somewhat uncomfortable.The ordering system is not entirely practical and is done from the mobile.The burgers are nothing special, the meat is rather dry and without much flavor. I ordered a BBQ and the barbecue was conspicuous by its absence. As for the potatoes, there is not much praise to be made either, somewhat dry, almost stiff.Those who say they are one of the best burgers in Barcelona really show that they don't know many burger shops in the city ...All this seasoned with certainly high prices for the quality and product they offer. Maybe I had a bad day in the kitchen, but first impressions are very important.From the staff, nothing to complain about, friendly and attentive.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant to order great burgers! Not only that, but the desserts and pizzas are spectacular !! If you want vice, this is your place. If you want to eat really well, this is your place. If you want a much more than personalized treatment, this is your place. Don't hesitate to order your food at home !!\n",
      "Best burger in Barcelona !! Love the vice originals üí´\n",
      "Always a hit, truffle cheeseburger and BBQ my favorites. Even the impressive potatoes.\n",
      "Very good burgers.The fatal wings.The potatoes with parmesan and truffle goodDesserts are worth nothing.In addition, you cannot pay with cash and you have to ask for it through the application, a roll. There is only one large, communal table with stools to sit on. All very uncomfortable.3 burgers2 wings1 potato2 waters2 soft drinks2 dessertsTotal: 53 euros\n",
      "The hamburgers were very good, the breadMax (no sesame. Thanks god!) Truffled potatoes from another world. Being a new place, the process is adjusting little by little. So patience and good chat with friends while you wait.100% quality üôåüèΩüôåüèΩü§òüèΩ\n",
      "Perhaps because it was just starting, it has not been the best experience. The QR issue is a bit of a mess and there was no willingness to help. If not for another client I would not have found out. The burgers good without going overboard. The potatoes a bit soggy. The waiting time in my case was excessive due to the amount of deliveries they receive. You cannot pay in cash. All with a bank card. Hopefully they improve as constructive criticism because I will not repeat in particular...\n",
      "Excellent service and stone oven pizzas. Recommendable.\n",
      "The burger is super good (BBQ chesseburguer), to say one downside is that it took literally 2 minutes to deliver 2 burgers with potatoes and dessert and they were somewhat cold just like the potatoes. It didn't seem freshly made and it's a shame because the flavor was so rich. Another thing that could perhaps be improved was the volume of the music and the type (techno) that I suppose who likes it great but who wants to dine quietly perhaps was excessive. It was like having dinner at the entrance of Pacha Ibiza, although I suppose the workers were motivated by listening to music üòÜ. It will surely give you a second chance.\n",
      "Slow (they give priority to Glovo orders) to order aCombo 30 min wait and then they get the wrong dessert. My burger was soggy overcooked dry my boyfriend was fine he liked it for this I put a star.\n",
      "I have to say that it is probably one of the best hamburgers we have ever tasted, I was afraid that they will arrive cold, but they have arrived more than perfect, in a more than striking bag ... I loved it, we have ordered the combo for two, We have ordered the truffle burgers that are from another world, it is a perfect combination, the super tasty potatoes and the amazing Oreo tiramisu. The packaging is spectacular from start to finish, an experience that we will repeat for sure! Congratulations on the work to the whole team!\n",
      "So far I had only tried a few hamburgers that had left me speechless and they were the \"Goiko\" but the truth is that Vicio's hamburgers are another level, the first time in Barcelona and we could not leave without trying them. Congratulations to Aleix and the entire team because they are going to give a lot to talk about!\n",
      "Please I have given you a good review, let me ask\n",
      "I would give it five stars, for attention, quality, presentation, but I went with my grandson to look for a hamburger for dinner and when we got home, disappointed, they gave us truffle instead of bacon, so I had to prepare a homemade one for him. little üòî\n",
      "Outstanding price-quality ratio. Cheeseburger as a first choice, to die for! Upgradeable potato chips\n",
      "Scandalous. Without a doubt the best burger I have ever eaten in my life. My girlfriend and I have ordered the 'couple goals' combo with two truffle burgers. When we have taken the first bite and the egg has exploded in our mouth we have hallucinated. Special mention for the nutella cheesecake, creamy and absolutely delicious. Fully recommended site if you pass through Barcelona.\n",
      "Incredibly good, it deserves the price you pay. The truffle is irresistible\n",
      "One of the best chicken burgers I've ever had. Very good packaging and very fast delivery, the hamburgers have arrived hot and the potatoes very crispy, to put a mistake, of the 6 wings, 1 raw wine\n",
      "The most horrible thing to eat\n",
      "Punctual and fabulous burgers that make the truth a real vice üòåü§§Thanks for the good treatmentüíñ\n",
      "Amazing burgers. But it is not a very good place to stay to eat there.\n",
      "We placed an order through a digital platform and after a while, Vice called us to inform us that the delivery man had picked up the order but that it had been lost. On the part of Vicio, they very sincerely apologized (taking into account that it was not their fault), they prepared the habmurgers for us again and made an agreement with the platform themselves to send another delivery man. Of course, it planted!ps: they sent us a delicious dessert that we hadn't ordered.Thank you very much Vice !! and all delicious as always;)\n",
      "A place that will surely close soon. They do not accept cash as a means of payment, they do not explain or guide how to order and the prices are not at all competent!\n",
      "Overrated. Much hype for so little chicha.\n",
      "A scandal!We have ordered bbq and truffle. The meat, the bread, the potatoes and the dessert: everything has a distinctive touch. From 10! And also, fast service and as we have collected it there, very good service. We will repeat and recommend it! Bravo ... Congratulations!\n",
      "All amazing. The burgers, the packaging, everything. We will repeat 100% for sure.\n",
      "Even the eggs of loud music all day, until almost midnight and the noise they make. Very bad coexistence, wishing they would leave\n",
      "Very rich burgersü§§\n",
      "The best burger I have eaten in Barcelona. Iberian, Truffled and Cheeseburger are spectacular and my favorites. Tasty fries and desserts (tiramisu and oreo) are VICIOUS.\n",
      "The burgers are incredible but the music so loud is unbearable\n",
      "I ordered Vice, the service was fast, the packaging tremendous, the beastly marketing and the food ... Vice.The fresh vegetables, the greasy meat, the soft bread, the tasty cheese and everything together ... Like hearing Overkill from Motorhead for the first time.It's been a long time since I spent all my nights thinking about the same thing ...Since I asked, I only think about vice, at all times and in all ways.Soon another score with more vice.\n",
      "For me, the best burgers right now in Barcelona! They are tremendous !!! But what makes them even better is the service behind them, always attentive and detailed. The two times we have asked we had problems with the delivery people and in both cases they worried about calling us and fixing it, although it had not been their fault directly. Thanks and congratulations to Aleix, Carlos and the entire team for your spectacular work!\n",
      "Very good packaging, super original, but personally I expected a better taste, a bit bland.\n",
      "Very well coordinated.\n",

      "Very rich burgers at a price a little higher than usual, even so it is worth going to try them, as a tip they come with a lot of potatoes that can be shared perfectly with two!\n",
      "The best burguers in the city!\n",
      "We asked for a glovo as the founder saw that Masterchef won. We ordered 4 different ones to try them all: the vegan one, the chicken one and two with beef. I was pleasantly surprised by the chicken and the vegan ones, but I have to say that as for the veal ones, I have eaten many better ones in other places. The desserts (we ordered two the oreo tiramisu and the nutella cheesecake) are delicious\n",
      "Spectacular burgers and pizzas.\n",
      "I love them, I have tried several empty ones and the truth is that they have put effort into all the packaging so that everything arrives in order and very well, I hope to soon be able to go to eat at the Restaurant and fill myself more with vice. the wings are to die for.\n",
      "We have ordered a bbq and a vice, the hamburgers very good, the order has arrived a little cold and the bread a little oily. Otherwise, it has a lot of flavor.The dessert without a spoon.But recommended!\n",
      "Brutal! The best burgers (and chicken wings) I've ever eaten üòç\n",
      "I have never been given so much pleasure with a meal ...Alexis if you see this review that you know that I leave you, definitely vice if it gives me mine ...\n",
      "Good accommodation, but they treated me 1h30 to serve the order + the delivery time. At peak times they are not enough. I hope they can improve it in the future and that customers can have compensation for it now, that if I left a physical restaurant I would have already left\n",
      "ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ I will be back !! I don t like it, i love it üòç good luck\n",
      "The service was excellent. On the weekend there is a lot of demand but the wait is worth it. We will repeat\n",
      "We ordered burgers, fries, and dessert. By far the best we've had in a long time! The point of the meat is perfect (we chose the vice and the bacon cheeseburger) the crispy and tasty potatoes (they have nothing to do with those offered by other burgers) and the oreo tiramisu is delicious.You can see that behind there is an incredible design work, the packaging materials denote quality and networking is another level! In short, you can see that the work is very well done and that is why although it may seem a bit expensive, if we take into account everything that is behind it, it is a more than fair price! It certainly deserves the fame it has!\n",
      "Just seeing it takes away the desire to eat, not to mention the price of ‚Ç¨ 14 and no differences or the meat.\n",
      "The burger was delicious! I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Through a delivery app, it is the second time I have ordered hamburgers at this establishment and it will not be the last ... since they are ... VICIOUS !!!Congratulations to your team and continue like this üí™\n",
      "The service and packaging is very good. However, I have ordered the truffle burger following recommendations from friends and I have hardly noticed the \"truffle\" flavor. Also, I would recommend putting an option from the point of meat, mine was well cooked. Much to envy of other burger restaurants in Barcelona\n",
      "Excellent service and the best burgers I have ever eaten !!! Not to mention the potatoes ü§§ We will repeat without a doubtüëåüèº\n",
      "The meat of the spectacular hamburger, the bread the same, to put a but the soft and oily potatoes, although you could tell that they were homemade, so I could not and will not ask again, the bacon made pure and charred, nor did it add any taste And the mouthfeel was unpleasant, it's worth it anyway.\n",
      "bad experience, hamburgers and fast food at a gold price!\n",
      "the packaging is fantastic. The service too. But the burgers better\n",
      "Spectacular burger. I will definitely repeat\n",
      "TREMEEENSS! We repeat that I would say el Ga√∫cho!\n",
      "We love Vice! Brutal burgers, tastys, freshyyyyyyyy!\n",
      "One of the best burgers we have ever tasted! Oh, and the fries are amazing!\n",
      "All great, I recommend it without a doubt üòç\n",
      "When you want to realize there is no hamburger left, only remains of the sauce from the mouth. A bit like when they don't remember to warn you;)\n",
      "A fantastic experience. It is sure that I repeat. The tasting menu is really top notch. It is a haute cuisine school. Although it is the students who serve you, they convey an incredible attitude and exquisite professionalism. Their teachers supervise them at a distance and you feel very well cared for at all times. They complement the menu with a varied pairing at all times. You feel like you are in the kitchen of famous chefs. The price-quality ratio is outstanding and they do not allow tips. Highly recommended üëèüëèüëèüëè\n",
      "A restaurant with a lot of treats and a great lunch and a great presentation\n",
      "We ate very well and they served us great !!!!\n",
      "The table service very well. The food quite regular ... the cuscus totally tasteless. I went hungry and I didn't finish it. Pasta and dessert also very basic. The head of the room asked me how was it, and when she saw that I didn't like it, she turned and left me with the word in her mouth. I do not put a star because the waiters were very friendly.The hotel school of Pueblo Nuevo makes millions of turns in every way.\n",
      "Very good value for money, with a very good table and a lot of attention to the aesthetics and presentation of the dishes. Very attentive service. In our case, they took dessert too long, and they didn't let us tip - they deserved it!\n",
      "We arrived for lunch at noon. The girl attends us very kindly and is going to ask who would be in charge of a table. He returns to the moment saying that it is a bit fair, that they give a table until 3:30 p.m. I look at the clock and it was 15:15! ? ... And this is a hospitality school ??? Well, they will not come out very well prepared in customer service.\n",
      "A good place to have a tasting menu, served by third and second year CETT students. Ours was Christmas, with a price of ‚Ç¨ 35. There were starters (tapioca crisp + prawn tartare + apple yarrow), eggplant wrap, fish (smoked dock), meat (low temperature lamb) and dessert (chocolate mousse + small fours). All this paired with cava (Estelada Ros√©), white wine (Vi√±a Esmeralda), red wine (Atrium Merlot), sweet wine (Floral Muscat), water, coffee and an infusion.\n",
      "A delightful experience. Exquisite food and exceptional service. They are very well prepared young people who make you feel as if you are in a Michelin star. I recommend the tasting menu.\n",
      "They have 2 tasting menus I recommend MENU D'AVANTGUARDA it is very good choice very well-arranged dishes highlight the Ceviche de Llagostins Calamr√ßet amb Trometas de la Mort and Melos de Vedella at low temperature with nuts and chestnuts, desserts and wine pairing and fabulous cava Service exquisite very well supervised perceive the sensation of a typical \"star\" restaurant in a center accredited as CETTI was previously a few years ago but I noticed changes in the design of the room and facilities but the quality and service certainly did not change I encourage you to continue in this line\n",
      "It eats well, but the place is not cozy.\n",
      "3.5 ‚≠êÔ∏èOverall, everything is fine.Expensive prices, but fairly large portions.The bread, DELICIOUS. Very good. The gold cap a 10.We fell in love with the \"Lizard\", very very good, although there were only four cuts of meat (19 ‚Ç¨). With a very good sauce.The ribs very well.The \"Lechazo\" well, but left us indifferent, and was worth 46 ‚Ç¨. Baked potatoes okay, but the chips we thought were frozen.For dessert, the cheesecake left a lot to be desired. We would not recommend it.But I lowered the score for several reasons.At first, we were frustrated because they have few dishes, but of the few, many did not. They had nothing in the stone. Of the four desserts, they also only had two. We understand that the situation is difficult, but that a place of meat does not have any of the dishes on the stone, at 1.30 noon ...Secondly, the QR letter only came out in Spanish. Our waiter also only spoke Spanish. We would like to be able to be attended to in Catalan.\n",
      "Excellent service, unbeatable food, great, great professionals\n",
      "Terrible! Awfully DELICIOUS restaurant! The menu is not big, but you don't need more. Excellent Dairy Pork and very Young Lamb! The Lamb is just 15 out of 10 and the Piglet is simply Delightful. We do not recommend going 1 time - you need to take this place for regular visits with your Family and friends.\n",
      "Good meat, and good service!\n",
      "I had been wanting to eat at this steakhouse for a long time after having gone to other similar ones in Barcelona. The truth is that the quality of the lamb is very good and the place is beautiful and spacious to respect the distance between diners due to the Covid issue. I did not like that after booking three weeks ago nobody will tell us that in San Esteban it was a closed menu and you could not order by letter (luckily my partner and I like practically everything, otherwise it would have been a problem). Christmas is quite complete, although second only is lamb, the soup of the starter I noticed a bit bland. I also did not like that the bottle of wine from the closed menu was already open (all the tables were the same). I consider that with a menu of 55 euros the place setting is to be appreciated for a lower quality wine but unopened ... The treatment of the staff and atmosphere of the cozy place, the donuts and the after-dinner liquor a detail.\n",
      "Great food. The staff is very attentive and kind\n",
      "Muy bueno todo, very delicious dinner. The lamb and beef are very good. The roast potatoes and bread are perfect. The interior decoration is classic. The exterior view is not as good as Tibidabo, but the parking is very convenient. I recommend everyone to come, and many locals come here. Home. I prefer lamb chops to lamb shanks, as well as after-dinner wine and snacks.\n",
      "Fantastic restaurant to enjoy a lunch or dinner, quiet space and good service. I recommend ordering the ribeye, it is one of the best I have ever eaten. For me 5 stars.\n",
      "Really very good. to eat calmly\n",
      "A CURIOUS THING IS THAT YOU GO THREE AS ‚Äã‚ÄãSIX, THE AMOUNT IS THE SAME!QUALITY IS SUPREME !.\n",
      "The meat restaurant. The meat plus or minus is good, almost all is slightly fat) the lamb is good. the place is not the most iconic, the wine list is simple. The same place at the foot of Tibidabo is much better\n",
      "A classic, but safe, good quality food and friendly staff\n",
      "Good gastronomy Although the service does not accompany the same level. The place is very typical of the group. Worth. Although the price is not economical.\n",
      "We have frequented it for many years and the changes are getting better.Our favorite dish the t-bone steak although all the dishes on the menu are fantastic.I recommend 100%\n",
      "It is a shop of Castilian Food in northern Spain. All dishes are delicious, but especially grilled Iberian pork is delicious. At around 20 euros per person, I enjoyed the appetizers, salads and grills, and I was very hungry.\n",
      "I love it! One of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa very good menu with delicious food, the suckling lamb and ribs cannot be missed. Good wine list and first class service, I always return. I recommend 100%\n",
      "Excellent product, good starters and best main dishes, amazing suckling always accompanied by great wines!\n",
      "Aranda's roast lamb does not fail !!A classic, very advisable if you like meat and good food. The very attentive service,First we got a pica-pica with sausage, black pudding, hash and roasted peppers with citrus touches, accompanied by a glass of cava.Second one of the star dishes: the LechazoFinally, for dessert, a puff pastry filled with custard and cream, very rich.How could it be otherwise a spectacular Ribera del Duero red wine to accompany the excellent meat.\n",
      "Cool. An excellent meal The staff is very attentive. Even the head chef took note of the food. We will be back!\n",
      "Good product, excellent preparation. Totally recommendable.\n",
      "The unbeatable treatment, the great food with the flavors of before. Price adjusted to quality.\n"

      "A very good place to eat meat, the price is a bit expensive but I understand that you have high costs for where you are located and due to the high quality of the raw material. The entrecote has seemed too small to me, used to eating entrecote in farmhouses in towns on the outskirts of Barcelona. The blood sausage and other dishes make a spectacular cuisine. One of Castilian origin around here who knows these dishes well ... if you sold at home it would be great. I don't know if you do it now, but if not, it is a good option.\n",
      "A spectacular suckling pig! We will repeat for sure!\n",
      "I will be very brief, after going repeatedly to this establishment, today we have returned with a client.We arrive at 2:00 p.m., and when we ask the waiter, he tells us that there are no Lamb chops, that they have run out ... It seems a bit strange to us since they have opened at 1:00 p.m., but go all over it's understandable.What is not understood is that the invoice amounts to ‚Ç¨ 165 and when we want to make the payment with a ‚Ç¨ 200 bill they tell us that it cannot be, that the bank does not accept it .....That we pay you with a different ticket.

The stone is changed without having to ask. At the end of the meal, they offer you some pastas and shots that come in handy.\n",

The place is l, original of its 45 years but very well preserved, they have inside d, another room with respect to the main dining room and entrance bar.Its Catalan / Basque cuisine is aromatic, forceful, and worked with local products. Stews of meat, fish (especially cod) pasta, soups, starters, mushrooms, etc. All dishes are well finished and presented.The room and kitchen service is attentive and close to dealing with customers.

      "With the utmost respect to the entire restaurant team, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE restaurant ABSOLUTELY.

I WOULD NOT REPEAT IN THIS PLACE.\n",
      "Spectacular, very familiar place with a private dining room for about 12 people. My favorite dishes, the potato with caviar, murgulas with foie, croquettes (ham, mushrooms ...) the clams, Iberian secret and the wagyu meat that is served in the pan.

      "The spectacular cod, and also the dessert, a highly recommended place, we will definitely return.\n",
      "Food: Very good. Rations: a little shorts, with the subject of cod, the meat is very good. Good but expensive desserts I saw it ..., Coffee: good. Space: you need a renovation. The attention: correct a little dry but correct.\n",

I love eating at this restaurant.12-23-18As always an excellent treatment and exquisite food.Perhaps young people or more modern people do not like the place as they indicate in some other comments that I have seen in a review.But for me it is one of the very few charming restaurants that remain in Barcelona.Restaurant with its own history üëçüëç\n",

      "The food. It is expensive but it eats very well.\n",
      "A restaurant that when it was active took important clients to taste homemade food, to remember old times I organized a dinner with friends. Total disappointment, a gray, expensive meal, and the waiters determined that we consume more wine.It does not have anywhere near the quality, the treatment, and the menu that I remember. I do not know how many people I recommended this restaurant, now with regret, I would not recommend it to any friend.\n",

It‚Äôs a source of pride to be a customer of a restaurant that has been demonstrating for so many years what it‚Äôs like to have a trade. I recommend the Nebraska steak or the Morels.

      "It's fine ... a typical, long-term restaurant with friendly and welcoming staff. The food made with desire and carinyo ... curious the contrast between a very traditional kitchen (kidney beans with bacon) and a more modern kitchen (loaf of garland) ... You must go at least once! surely repeat Daily menu with many first and second to choose for ‚Ç¨ 20\n",
      "I have ordered ravioli from the yaya for the first course, they have brought cannelloni that, feeling it very much, does not seem homemade. Second course cod with Alioli, the aioli would be one of those sold in the supermarket, it does not have the flavor of the usual aioli, the one prepared by the yaya. Very good for tourists who do not know the taste of home cooking. He has lost a lot. Greetings.\n",
      "Iaia weekend menu, 19.5. Generous ration, homemade and rich food. We ordered fish soup, cannelloni (very good) and pate ravioli (somewhat salty). In seconds, cod with spinach cream (spectacular), fricand√≥ de vedella (very good), lamb ribs and flamingos. Desserts were good too, highlighting the chocolate coulant.As the only bad point, the dishes were staggered at the wrong time, so it was 10 minutes between the first and last.We will repeat without a doubt, rich, at a good price and 5 minutes walking from the Sagrada Familia.\n",

      "Classic and cozy place.Good product with a very good elaboration. Great variety of dishes to choose from.Attentive and friendly service.Good value for money, but pulling towards expensive.\n",
      "Said to be closed on Sundays but there are just guests sitting inside. In short: I am not allowed in it alone ?!\n",
      "The quality and quantity has less and the price more. The only set that remains is cod. The service is unfriendly and nothing professional. Every day less recommended\n",

      "Very friendly, we were short on time and they did their best to be able to serve quickly. The grilled vegetables very well and the goat roll salad too. The ribeye .... very good, according to the rest of the food. For dessert, freshly prepared Catalan cream, very good too. Totally recommendable.\n",
      "Special lunchtime menu great to invite your partner and clients or suppliers. It was a bit hot by the way in the indoor dining room today 10/20/2021. He fixed himself by taking desserts and coffees on the outside terrace.\n",

      "The best restaurant in BCN I've been to so far.In addition to excellent cuisine and treatment, the recommendations were very good for us to choose the wine or the tumaca bread as a starter / side.There is no but.The atmosphere, also 10(Photos are missing of a \"green\" gazpacho that they gave us to try as well as the potatoes that accompanied the ribeye)\n",
      "Nice place, good dishes and attentive staff. They have a highly recommended ribeye menu. Good value for money.\n",

      "Brutal! We love coming with the family to this restaurant because it is ‚Äúgood, nice and cheap‚Äù. In addition, it has a very complete and well-priced lunch menu.

      "A very cozy restaurant, they have treated us great and the food is very good !!!\n",
      "I recommend !Very good, homemade, a mixture of flavors, pretty plates, adorable waiters with little attentions. We were taken by the weather but we will come back to taste the desserts!In the photo, these are homemade croquettes, 3 different tastes, very nice for once you don't have to choose the taste!\n",
      "The meat is very good together with spectacular grilled artichokes !! the only downside is that when I went, I didn't even know that the extractor in the kitchen didn't work very well but the smoke reached upstairs, where I was sitting with my friends. I hope it is something specific because it is very good, I recommend it.\n",
      "I receive advertising, through a media outlet, from this site, which I do not know. It is advertised as Vic Braseria and with many Catalan specialties. But, curiously, neither the advertisement nor any of his letters are in this language, which I consider a remarkable lack of consideration.\n",
      "Rectifying is wise. A few months ago I put a star on you and I was disappointed in the service. Today all are praises for this restaurant. The quality of the product is spectacular, delicious and powerful. The friendliness of the wonderful waiter. We will definitely be back.\n",

      "How you notice that the people of Osona have good bait !! 9 months of winter and 3 of hell !!\n",
      "Bad service and really bad steaks with scary prices! Now that owners do not know their own food tarlik, I choose to add more pictures of his bad steak containing 200 grams of bone and 200 grams of fat and with a price of 50 ‚Ç¨ per kilo you can count on what you pay. Not to mention that he opens bottles of beer at the bar and divides it into glasses before serving, two small cans of beer he divides into three glasses that he charges for. Do not forget that he also pays for his poor service, and it is not in the menu. Good and ashamed of everything.\n",
      "Negative experience. We did not get to taste the food. We had a terrace reservation. We arrived and tables were occupied. After 25 minutes of waiting a waitress tells us to take a table for us. After another 10 minutes, another waiter comes out and tells us that the kitchen closes at 4:00 p.m. The thing about taking table nothing. Who will bring the bill to the group and wait for the table to clear. The group had not appeared for almost 15 minutes, having finished eating. If they had worried they would have probably already left. It is bad to write negative things at this time, but they should serve to improve. We went to eat somewhere else.\n",
      "Simply 2 words Excellent and Excellent, extraordinary treatment of the waitress and exquisite food, quality price a 10, we will return to taste more dishes.\n",

      "Good daily menu with a good price and a lot of choice.\n",
      "Cozy decorated, good treatment, fast service and good price !!!We ordered the menu (just over ‚Ç¨ 11). Fresh salad, neither abundant nor poor in quantity; The very tasty, tender and grilled meat came accompanied (paying a small supplement) with homemade potatoes. The dessert was also made by them (brownie) and despite being a little hard the top layer, it was also very good (this is the only one but I found !!). Recommended and great value for money\n",
      "We passed by here and stayed on the terrace. All great! We are not very carnivores, so we ordered cod carpaccio, sausage and broken eggs with ham, among other things. Great service, very attentive, nice place. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "Great! Great! Great! The menu is wonderful and everything has its taste of charcoal and firewood, fabulous prices compared to the quality of the dishes that is quite high, it has 3 very different environments I recommend the upper part or the entrance, then there is another one down some stairs that It is very dark and does not feel very good. Very good attention!We will be back for sure!\n",
      "All very good and the staff very attentive. The only q we had bad luck and there was a table of 3 people but very noisy. For the rest all 10 !!!!!\n",

      "Tremendous place to eat Colombian food !!! We loved it. The freshly made empanadas, with a lot of shredded meat filling and chips. The corn arepa with cheese shows that the products are fresh. The delicious rib broth, on a belly very well cooked and with rice, egg and avocado, very rich. Spectacular homemade rice pudding. The wonderful treatment, very attentive, everything very clean and organized, a ten. The site has a lot of charm and the music at an adequate volume that you can speak. Truly, a great find that we will go back to for sure. Congratulations to the owners! üíú\n",
      "We were a group of 4 people with reservation.They have large water of 1.5 liters, so we asked that to share all. From starter we ordered 2 empanadas and potatoes. And food, a three phase arepa, a three-phase corn arepa, a banana with meat and a tamale. All the food was very good, we got enough, almost everything had potatoes, so it was quite satisfying.The attention of the staff was somewhat slow, the appetizers took a long time and we delayed paying, there were not many people to make it an excuse.Recommended place to try the Colombian cuisine, place very well decorated and with music of the place. Very good price, we left at around ‚Ç¨ 13 per person.\n",

      "The arepas are very rich and good value for money well\n",

      "Very good site. I'll be back for sure! The arepas are to death. Especially those of beef. The rather normal chicken ones but that I suppose will be a matter of taste. The others were tastier. But all spectacular. Don't ask for the salads! They are more boring than I know. They have Colombian beers and in the bar they sell typical Colombian products as well. Eating two sands in this place is already expensive! Great, value for money as it should be!\n",
      "excellent service, spectacular atmosphere. We went as a family and we loved it. The divine arepas, the combined todooo salchipapa and the frozen beers üëå\n",
      "Superb quality and homemade food. The waiter is very polite and friendly. A great experience!\n",
      "We just bounced last Sunday mid-afternoon.And the truth is that the food was very good. We ordered an arepa for each one and some potatoes. And it was all very good!Very friendly waiter, who helped us choose.We will return to try the arepas de choclo. And also the banana ones.\n",
      "Good food in a central location\n",
      "Very good service and exquisite food thank you very much the waiter very friendly good service\n",
      "Colombian food. The negative is that they are quite slow.\n",
      "The place is good, the quantities are not very big but enough. A paisa tray between two goes just right. Prices are good. They have no dessert. The attention is right.\n",
      "I have gone for the first time and the truth is I did not like it at all ... I have ordered a sancocho and honestly they served us a very basic water with dad, I also lost a passion fruit juice in milk and they charged me 6 euros ... Super expensive and it was not a big deal either, and to finish the customer service very precarious, the waiter is a Spanish elderly man and does not wear a uniform or anything representative of Colombia, the only thing that can be saved is the decoration and atmosphere of the place of rest nothing more, I will not go again the truth I did not like it at all\n",
      "What I've tried, yummy. Good portions / quantities. For half a day I recommend the menu, very homemade food (for col: the typical lunch of current)\n",
      "Total disappointment!!! I have been with great enthusiasm and desire to enjoy some real Arepas, like the ones I tried on my last trip to Colombia. Horribly tough, with a chicken breast that looked more like washed in a washing machine than cooked; tasteless, insipid and pale .... now I understand the insistence of the man that he will use the hot sauce üòÜ, I should have trusted my feeling as soon as I entered, which was: - the sole of my shoes that stayed glued to the ground how dirty it was and the terrible music it had .... well, unfortunately, NOTHING RECOMMENDED !!!\n",
      "A TERRIBLE experienceüòñüëéI would call it the ARE-PLASTICO !!Some arepas inedible, hard and seemed plastic.I feel bad to put a bad comment but the owner earned it.When I told him they were not fresh arepas, he was rude.We will EVER be back!POOR QUALITY, POOR HYGIENE, AND MISSING THE. OWNER HUMILITY TO AVOID COMMENTS WRITTEN ON GOOGLE LIKE MINE!\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "An exquisite decoration, some dishes faithful to their origin, very good, a cordial and very close treatment, do not miss the impressive models of galleons, totally recommended\n",
      "Two arepas ‚Ç¨ 14 one of meat that was still passable but the other of cheese seemed plastic. Maybe it was a take away thing. But value for money to my taste bad, I will not repeat\n",

      "We went with a group of friends, we asked the waiter if he could join us tables, since at one table we did not change all. He with reluctance and a bad face did it, the command took a long time.Although the wait was worth it for the food.\n",
      "Excellent attention and food !.\n",
      "Super rich Colombian food!\n",
      "Good attention and delicious meals üëåüèº\n",
      "The banana with meat and arepa de choclo with chicken is very good.Very good prices. I recommend !\n",
      "Very expensive in relation to the product and unfriendly service. It was tasty but we ate simple dishes and it was expensive. We waited for the waiter and although we were the only customers, it took half an hour to serve us.\n",
      "The food was very good, but we called on this occasion before going, and they told us that it was open, when we arrived they told us that there was no food, only arepas, and that we come from Rubi, that's why we called before not We lost the way, but we lost it, and not only that, the waiter (the boy with the ponytail) super unfriendly, it is not the first time he has attended us, the most correct thing is that when we called they would have told us what they had ...\n",
      "Very rich arepas, well priced and super nice staff! We have tried the triphasic and the egg one with some creole potatoes. Don't forget to try the Colombian beers.\n",

      "Very good experience, the attention is spectacular. The quality of the dishes is exquisite. Highly recommended\n",
      "We had to wait over an hour for some tapas and much more for my order; And that it was homemade food, no sophisticated or elaborate dish, terrible service. If you go for dinner, you should go prepared to eat at midnight.\n",
      "Much folklore in the environment, rich texture, somewhat high price and slow attention. Pass and draw conclusions!\n",
      "Colombian cuisine, it's not just about arepas, stews, mixed, soups, juices and much more. All great. Very good atmosphere.\n",
      "Slimming experience. The reviews on the web suggested that it was very good. Expectations were high. The food was generally not satisfactory. Ordered steak but it was a thin piece of meat. The accessories were disappointing. the only positive was the salad. That's not what I expected. the sound from the TV above the head ruined the mood. Although the place had charm.Never go back. possibly that is great by South American standard.\n",
      "Excellent attention and cozy atmosphere. Totally recommended.\n",
      "It is a very good quality Colombian food restaurant at an affordable price. Possibility of a very complete menu on Sundays. The waiter is very nice and the cuisine is very good!\n",
      "The service has been fast and the place is nice, but the arepa was bland, with gummy and heavy meat ... I would not recommend it\n",
      "Excellent üëå service üëç\n",
      "The food is quite good and the place is nice. Penalty of the service, that went crazy and lost orders The dishes took a long time. Go with patience and time or you will have a bad time. We had to leave without having coffee because it was not enough. The music was a bit too loud and it ended up disturbing.\n",
      "The very colorful place with good music! The amazing beef arepas! However the quality of attention was not bad but not good either!\n",
      "Very good food and very nice place. The service: very slow. I hope you improve it, I would like to come back.\n",
      "Good food. But excessive charge ‚Ç¨ 7 for a basic salad and ‚Ç¨ 3 more for an avocado ...\n",
      "To taste the colors, I personally do not like the food of this place, after a long time I came back to see if they had changed but it is still the same, 12 euros the menu and really nothing good, the cook lacks more about the Colombian flavors , Today's menu was sancocho, and second on belly, the very maluco sancocho and the overbarriga very different from how it is seasoned in Colombia, they serve you rice, a piece of over belly and a fried egg, I will never come back. I prefer to go to the spoon that is delicious.\n",
      "The food was delicious and the attention excellent, it was like feeling in Colombia. Super recommended\n",
      "Pleasant atmosphere. A bit fair letter. Adjusted Price. Good atmosphere. We will repeat\n",
      "I give 3 stars only that everything in this world can be improved, the food was normal and little amount for price there is no homemade dessert and it is horrible for places of this type, where you come to try typical food and that is not mercadona . Music very loud and in bad taste (it was Christmas).\n",
      "Good but very expensive\n",
      "An excellent meal ‚ô• Ô∏è keep it up\n",

      "Good place, typical Colombian food excellent treatment.\n",
      "Boring and dry food..stuff service.\n",
      "The best Sancocho, arepa, chorizo, Creole potatoes. Excellent all the food and the atmosphere!\n",
      "Good place to try Colombian food, the owner is very kind and friendly, the arepas and plantains are well priced, the other dishes are a little more expensive but all very good. Empanadas are a \"Must\" on this site. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Very good value for money food, delicious taste. The bad: there are hardly ever empanadas! and that they turn on the TV with very high volume with programs that damage the entire Colombian environment. They should set with Colombian music, in the background, that does not interrupt the conversation of the people at the table.\n",
      "Very good food. Educated people. It is the best Colombian food place in Barcelona.\n",
      "Excellent. Very good\n",
      "Typical Venezuelan restaurant.\n",

      "The portions are a good size, but there are no more. The dishes are bland and the service is more attentive on TV than serving and charging what is due.\n",
      "EXCELLENT ATTENTION AT ALL TIMES.MUY RIKA THE FOOD üòãüòãüòãüòã\n",
      "Rich tray paisa, the sancocho would have to be more sancocho, as it is seen in the menu, q can be differentiated between the potato, the yucca, banana ... Attention good, and special place, the, decoration is typical, I recommend it !!!\n",
      "For what you can expect from a Colombian restaurant in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe prices are reasonable, especially those of the arepas, which are also very good (they are the reason that makes me come back, in fact). Next to the box there is a counter with Colombian candies (for the nostalgic or the curious it will be very good). One catch: the parakeet eggs are usually considerably over salt.\n",
      "Nice place, great variety of arepas above all and some other dishes, good seasoning, well priced, fast and friendly service.\n",
      "Very good service and delicious food. I would expand the menu a bit, but this place is worth it.\n",
      "Recommended sancocho and paisa tray. Everything is very pricey.\n",
      "Very good attention, quick to serve. A very nice cozy atmosphere, it is a place where you are transported to your place of origin (Colombia).I liked his honesty in a recommendation I asked him about a set.A unique detail that would change was that I asked for a water-panela (typical drink) to drink right there in the premises and it was served in a disposable cup. but what was expected was good.Otherwise a pleasant experience.\n",
      "I love food and I recommend it\n",
      "We have gone several times and it is very good. The food is good for when you have a Colombian craving\n",
      "Excellent place the food transports you to your origins clean and with good attention I recommend it\n",
      "Discreet, clean, friendly, good service and good food.\n",
      "Not bad at all, in the neighborhood there is a lot of competition in Colombian restaurants. This wins in prices. It's a good option. Something slow service ... but it's Colombia :)\n",
      "Nice place, good quality and good service, the beer should be colder\n",
      "Good music and nice place\n",
      "The restaurant is very good I am fascinated by the decoration .. the food is fine\n",
      "The smoked rib is delicious, but the best thing about this place is the juices, a little expensive but they are very worth it. If you want to treat yourself, gun√°bana juice with soy milk is a pleasure\n",
      "Very good arepas in a very typical place\n",
      "The food did not taste anything just flavoring, to the point of scalding the tongue and not being able to sleep because of the pain in the stomach and having to be drinking water all night, in my case I will not return or recommend it.\n",
      "Very good, if it weren't for a bit slow ... Very good if you go slowly. I will return for sure, the delicious arepas. I recommend it, but yes, without hurry.\n",
      "Good food\n",

      "Super delicious arepas are made of pure corn, all the food is good.\n",
      "Very very good menu and service\n",
      "After waiting 20 minutes they did not want to attend us, so we left. While we were leaving, they told us that we had better leave. So, directly. Racism? I dont know...\n",
      "Excellent food, quality and price. I recommend it!\n",
      "Very high prices for what it is. The food is rich, the meat and the arepa were hard,nothing of the other world, normal attention.\n",
      "A good price-quality option to eat Colombian. Well cared for\n",
      "Amazing sands !!! I recommend the three phase!\n",
      "Pure gastronomy, very homemade! In a very cozy place with a polite and friendly staff. A pleasure\n",

      "They do not falter in any culinary aspect. All specialties, not just sushi, delicious. Special mention to the flamed salmon.\n",
      "The food is very rich and varied. It has good value for money. The menu offers a large number of options for all tastes and everything is very detailed. You can eat inside or outside on the terrace. Waiting times are short.\n",
      "Quality, quantity, price very good.Lacks cleanliness\n",
      "Bad experience. The waitress has been very rude and the food is not good enough to bear her rudeness.\n",
      "They are very slow, at exaggerated levels, acceptable food quality.Very poor local hygiene ...Friendly but very unprofessional. High price, not at all suitable in the restaurant.Highly recommended.\n",
      "Restaurant to go to eat, without more. If you go hungry you will surely like it, but it is another Chinese restaurant disguised as Japanese. When you arrive they do not treat you very kindly, you are lucky if they look at you, hahahaha. But hey, once you are inside and you call them, they will attend to you.Total, it's fine, but don't expect anything from the other world. It is not Japanese, but they have sushi, makis, various noodles, rice, etc. You can see it in the photos.\n",
      "Amazing sushi, both the texture and the taste. The service is very good, everything is super clean and the waiters are very friendly. They bring the dishes very fast. We will be back !!\n",
      "For me, the best buffet a la carte in Barcelona. The quality is very good and the service is correct and fast. My partner and my mother love to go to this restaurant. I recommend it!!\n",
      "Nice design, kitchen without wow effect. But the staff on a solid bad grade ... no desire to return because of the service !!!\n",
      "-: Unfriendly waitress, no explanation, does not answer questions from tourists. Incomplete order, and arrives in the wrong order (dish before entry). 2 buffets are counted on the bill while we only received one dish out of the 2 ordered- small quantities+: the dishes were good.\n",
      "Cons: rude waitress, not listening, no explanation about the different cards, incomplete order but everything was counted on the receipt,addition paid in full to avoid a conflict with the manager, no logical order in the service of the dishes.Zero communication to customers.Positive point: the taste is there.\n",
      "Good restaurant for simple dinners. If you like Japanese restaurants, it will not disappoint you. The food is very good and you do not stay hungry.\n",
      "Well, the service is correct. And the quality fits the price. I recommend going with calm and time.\n",
      "It is very possible that you will be hungry after having been there waiting for 3 hours, 2 skewers arrive every half hour, on top of it it tells you directly not to order more food that is taking a long time.The half that we have asked have not been brought to us.The owner very edge.Worst buffet experience ever, no exaggeration.\n",
      "Bad experience we ate here and after taking the first order they took away the room temperature sushi menus not good to avoid\n",
      "I have waited 40 min for the first course but everything was delicious.\n",
      "Very good service, spectacular food and above all a quiet and cozy atmosphere\n",
      "The place has table service and there is a terrace. I went with some friends and they looked after us very well and quite quickly. Highly recommend the spicy tuna california.\n",
      "Correct restaurant, good and fast service, normal prices and variety on the menu.\n",
      "I love to eat here with my friends or my family, it is a very good buffet\n",
      "Site not recommended at all,We have only been able to order 3 times and the first two have not brought us even half.In other words, we have come to a buffet and we have not been able to eat more than 10 pieces of sushi per person.For that we have lost 3 hours with endless waits‚Ä¶ .. order a tray from Telemaki and you will save yourself the wait.Hopefully one day I get my bathroom\n",
      "The worst buffet in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwe live right next door, but we will never return. The quality is normal to low, but the worst thing is not the food but the service, from the minute one they have taken a lot to serve us, on top of that they only let you order a few dishes at the same time and then they bring you less quantity than what you ask. When we wanted to order the second batch (since in the first they hardly brought anything) no one came to look for the paper with the plates pointed out and after 10 minutes of waiting I got up to give it directly to the manager and with bad manners she told me to sit at the table and now she was coming to get the paper.\n",
      "Good sushi, but extremely slow.\n",
      "Super good everything and excellent service! Without a doubt to repeat!\n",
      "Good quality and serviceExcellent foodBuffet at a great price and quality\n",

      "Very general MSG, wonton very salty, I ate a bowl and drank two bottles of water OMG\n",
      "Food very good. Now they have a buffet for about ‚Ç¨ 13.\n",
      "Very good sushi, good atmosphere, better to get there without a car, difficult to park like in Barna center\n",
      "First of all, The waitress was very rude, the times we asked she treated us in a way that made us uncomfortable!Second the meals were served on small plates.I didn't like the taste of the sushi.\n",
      "Very good value for money, eat everything you can for ‚Ç¨ 17, the service is very friendly.\n",
      "Very good sushi, varied pieces and dishes that you don't see in other buffets that almost always have the same. Also very nice presentation.\n",
      "Pos my daughter likes this site over others! We will be back\n",
      "We have come to eat a few times with friends and I have to say that the buffet option at the lunch table is a good option for small tastings of various dishes and enjoy.\n",
      "They take a while to serve ....... but \"to\" well, a great snack-meal\n",
      "The food is very good and varied. It is advisable to book before going as it gets busy. The very affordable price.It would only improve 3 things, between courses they take too long (since it is a Letter buffet, I think that is the Strategy) and that the waitress who served us was not extremely friendly. If you ask for cutlery, they only bring you a fork and not a knife.Otherwise all great\n",
      "All very fresh quality porducto the truth very good even though it has no tuna shasimi for the rest very fresh, unfortunately the mosquitoes were a few in the sink worse for the rest all good\n",
      "A good place to sample Japanese cuisine at a great price\n",
      "Good quality price. Improvable service.\n",
      "For ‚Ç¨ 10 you can choose three dishes from the menu. The price is cheap for the portions, which apart from delicious are abundant. The service is quite fast. I recommend it 100%.\n",
      "Value for money is probably the best Asian restaurant in Barcelona. Don't expect luxuries, but the food is very good and the price is half thatmost of the surrounding restaurants.\n",
      "Good quality and variety.\n",
      "Very good food and attention, although the table was 6.\n",

      "I liked the food, but a long wait between courses\n",
      "All very good, the portions are small so you can try more dishes, I will be back.\n",
      "The place has improved a lot since my last visit (more than a year ago). They reformed it and now it is brighter, cleaner and more harmonious. The service has also gained a lot. The manager speaks Spanish well and is very attentive. The quality of the food is good, with a free buffet a la carte. I highly recommend trying the nigiri and makis combo (plate 120). Thai soup is very good and spicy !! The duck, wonton soup, shrimp rice and seaweed salad are worth it. At night it costs ‚Ç¨ 14.95 and it is worth it, since you can eat until you finish like the piggy bank they have at the bar.\n",
      "A pleasure of flavors in a pleasant place at a reasonable price\n",
      "Good quality but something serious that yes\n",
      "Japanese buffet. A la carte dishes are ordered, as many as you like. There is a lot of variety, salads, soups, rice, noodles, meat and sushi.The best are the sushis although they take a little time to serve them. The variety is fine, but there is little \"special\" sushi.The only but is that of the general dishes there is a lot of fried dish and the quality of these is not so good.There is also a lunch menu although I have never tried it\n",
      "At first it seems fine, the food is fine, but at the buffet the service is very bad. They do not take all the dishes you ask for and the plateau becomes somewhat irritable after the first order. For the food I would return but I will not do it for the service\n",
      "Very authentic Chinese and Japanese cuisine! The sashimi is very generous!\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "The service has been terrible, bad looks and lost dishes.\n",
      "I have been to Yuan Man for lunch and will certainly return there again.At lunch you can choose the menu option or the all you can eat option. The menu costs 9.90 euros and includes three dishes including sushi, hot dishes and appetizers, soft drink, dessert or coffee and I must say that the quality of the food is superior to other menu restaurants.For those wishing to try many types of sushi, there is the very advantageous all you can eat option that costs ‚Ç¨ 12.90.In general, the place is clean and tidy, quite spacious and very bright, the normal service apart from a few language problems with the staff who however did not prevent us from enjoying lunch.Food 4Local 3.5Service 3Cleaning 4Atmosphere 4Quality / price 4.5\n",
      "The worst restaurant I've been to in Barcelona. I was guided by the reviews, but I honestly don't know what people eat on a daily basis.Very poor quality, nothing to do with the photos on the menu, small quantities. Terrible attention, they forget about the dishes you are ordering, they give you what they want. To avoid.\n",
      "Very poor service attitude, like throwing things on the table.\n",
      "Not bad, having Buffett you can order as many times as you want. But there is nothing left.Very friendly in service\n",
      "Great restaurant!I am satisfied to have come to lunch in this restaurant!Staff smiling, enthusiastic and kind.Although they do not speak French, we manage to communicate in English.Fast serviceMeal very good, I recommend Japanaese salad because it tastes great and is a real treat for the taste buds!You will not regret having put 10.80 ‚Ç¨ in the meal!\n",
      "A highly recommended site! It has an √† la carte buffet, with a wide variety of dishes. The buffet costs ‚Ç¨ 14.95 at night and includes everything you want to order, except drinks and desserts and is served at the table. The place has a terrace on Girona street. The food is very good in general, particularly the sushi. The staff is very friendly and the treatment is very good. We will be back for sure.\n",
      "Good quality price!\n",
      "I have already been a few times and I have always ended up delighted by the variety of dishes and the food, the sushi is very good and they make it to you at the moment, the staff are very attentive\n",
      "Good quality, desirable service\n",
      "The food very good and very friendly. But they take too long to bring the food, approximately 45min after ordering, and then when you want to order more it is the same.\n",
      "We have known yuan man for about 6 years and we are absolute fans! We have also seen how it has modernized its menu and style. Very good service and good buffet food.\n",
      "I love this restaurant. Whenever I return to Barcelona I go to eat. Free buffet. Excellent shrimp and duck dumplings. Very good makis and excellent rice and fish cut. Unbeatable treatment.\n",
      "Very friendly treatment, with good memories since I came to repeat. The price is the standard for sushi in Barcelona. The night and weekend price differs from the daily price.\n",
      "The menu a 10. The food very good. The bad, no heating. Just a butane stove that doesn't pull. I don't come back until summer. I have frozen and eating cold is not cool. In addition, I have ordered a Sapporo 3 times and I go without it.\n",
      "A sushi restaurant, no more. The attention leaves much to be desired, the kindness of the lady who attended us was conspicuous by its absence. The boy, a little younger if he has treated us very correctly. They served us two servings for two different people on the same plate so that you can get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe size of the meals. The truth is that the quality of the sushi is not the best and for the same price you can find much better sushi restaurants than this one. Personally, I would not recommend it.\n",
      "Great, excellent service!\n",
      "delicious, super recommendable, and very good price.\n",
      "It is one of my favorite sushi places and they are very nice. The truth is that it is worth it ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n",
      "It depends on the day the food takes a little wait, but it's worth it! The best Japanese buffet without a doubt!\n",
      "The best of barcelona\n",
      "Value for money is very good. A bit of a hassle with the orders but the food is delicious.\n",
      "It is not a delicacy but you can not ask for that for what you pay. Still I have to say that it is the best restaurant of this type that I have tried (Asian buffet a la carte).The only downside is that sometimes they take a while to attend.\n",
      "The food was not bad but the service is very bad, they did not take all the dishes that were ordered and when we mentioned it to the waitress, she would get annoyed\n",
      "I liked it, a nice cozy and quiet place, the food is good in quality price, it is a buffet a la carte, I liked the well-made rolls and good ingredients, friendly service.\n",
      "Highly recommended! Quite a variety of dishes, even a variety of vegetarian dishes.The portions are like tapas, and everything is delicious! Cold ones are not oily at all.I recommend going with time and calm, the staff are very friendly. Good value for money.\n",
      "Variety to choose from.\n",
      "As always ... the best buffet sushi I've ever had\n",
      "Very good and there is space between the tables, according to the regulations for the pandemic. In addition, the attention is immediate and they have very good products.\n",
      "The food was good and the portions right. Very good attention from the staff and a nice atmosphere.\n",
      "Terrible service. Very slow in serving food from one plate to another, we were more than 2 hours from the moment we entered. Little quantity in each plate. First buffet I'm going hungry. On the other hand, the food was very tasty. I do not recommend it.\n",
      "The prawns with pepper, delicious. I loved it, I recommend it.\n",
      "The food is good as always, although a very big drawback is that now if you go alone there is no free buffet, which was not cheap but exquisite, a shame because I will not return.\n",
      "Fast food restaurant with a higher quality than Burger King or McDonalds but exaggerated prices. The quality of the product is good, with a very tasty meat, and the decoration reminds the locals of the 50/60, but paying 52 euros for four hamburgers, four drinks and two potatoes for me is disproportionate. One good thing they have is that you can choose from 100 drink combinations that you can refill as many times as you want.\n",
      "I liked it, good for them! Exquisite potatoes.\n",
      "Large place with two floors and what to say about burgers and smoothies ... delicious! I recommend the cajun potatoes.\n",
      "It won‚Äôt be the cheapest burger you eat, but it sure will be one of the best. Quality ingredients with a high capacity for customization.\n",
      "This is a five guys hot-dog. Appalling. And it is not that you are cheap.\n",
      "Fast food at set menu prices, from any of the restaurants around the mall. I see it too expensive for a hamburger and fries. To my opinion.\n",
      "Good food, a little expensive, but the burgers are good, also the potatoes, very homemade.The guy who attended us very kindly explained how everything worked.\n",
      "Good experience. You arrive, you order your hamburger (better double because they are small) you put the toppings or sauces you want because they are free. Very good potatoes and free refillable machine drink. What I did not like at all is that they serve you the hamburger in aluminum foil. It is a useless waste of paper, better in a tray and now\n",
      "I was expecting better quality overall.The smoothie is very dense, the cardboard straw lasts a few minutes before falling apart, the taste very monotonous, it just tasted like peanut butter despite having other ingredients. The variety of the menu is quite limited and the service is not fast.I will not come back.\n",
      "10 burgers and the amazing bacon chocolate shake! Attention of 10 by the workers !! And punctual both in the restaurant and in home delivery\n",
      "We have come to try it and the truth is that we really liked it!The potatoes are crazy! The delicious Milkshake and the person in charge of duty, a love of person, super attentive and nice.\n",
      "I have had a problem with the Glovo order, I have been able to speak directly with the establishment and they have been super decisive. I have forgotten to ask the name of the girl who has attended me to be able to thank her. Great attention and food.\n",
      "The main product is quality but that's it. The rest of the experience would be fine if the prices were better, but for me pay ‚Ç¨ 14 for a hamburger, water and potatoes served on silver paper and cardboard bags ... And if you stay for lunch or a tray they will put you. Finally good product but very regular overall experience for the price. For those ‚Ç¨ 14 you go to Fosters Hollywood where they have a similar or better product, served on a plate by a waiter, much more variety, and in a more cozy place. Where is it going to stop?\n",
      "Good attention, the air conditioning does not work, the bathroom was very dirty; As for the food Good burgers and rich hot dogs, a variety of drinks with the soda machines, the potatoes were inedible cold burnt and chewy!\n",
      "Typical American hamburger restaurant, high quality products, they stand out because their fries are made with peanut oil and because they have Coca-Cola with a lot of flavors, you will not be able to resist trying them all!\n",
      "Generally well especially the drinks. The hamburgers are good but they are nothing of the other world, the meat does not ask you how you want it, they give it a good time. For that price there are much better places.1 Large Hamburger (same as the small one but with two hamburgers inside)1 Normal burger1 medium potato2 soft drinks1MilkshakeAll this ‚Ç¨ 33\n",
      "Very good quality burger. Designed 100% to everyone's taste.The price is very affordable. Five Guys style potatoes are very good. And there are always free peanuts. But what I enjoy most, since it does not exist anywhere else, are with drinks:Original Coca-Cola machines where you can find many different types that are not marketed in Spain. In addition these machines also have the other drinks in the house like Fanta, Sprite, Aquarius, etc. of many different flavors.To personal taste, my favorite is the loan fanta. üòâ\n",
      "The burgers are delicious and the shakes with \"original\" flavors too. I recommend it.\n",
      "A little expensive to be fast food. The ingredients are better than in other fast food.\n",
      "The truth that I expected much more. I do not know if I'm used to some bigger hamburgers but I've known a little. Although one can put the 15 toppings for free! In short, the big place and I liked to put stairs for people to do a little exercise. The soda machines I think are original & the option of spicy potatoes too.\n",
      "Super good! The price is very good for what you get. Genuine burgers, perfect attention and fast service. The crunchiest bacon I've ever tasted in my life. The potatoes are with skin and they are delicious, you have all the drink and sauces you want (refillable glasses). There is also an unlimited supply of roasted peanuts (really good, really, and saladets).I will repeat.\n",
      "I do not usually put 5 stars anywhere, but the quality of the Hamburger and the different flavor of the potatoes makes me put it, I have gone to many hamburgers but it has something different. To start you order the hamburger and you can put the topings or ingredients you want except the cheese that is paid separately and that is brutal. The potatoes are made with super rich peanut oil, the different flavor is noticeable and then you can refill the drink as many times as you want. For you to know, the service it has is just to give you the food, there is no table service. One of the drawbacks that this establishment has in the machinist, is that it has an upstairs and has no beverage dispensers in the area above. 100% recommended\n",
      "Great fast food restaurant. Delicious American typical hamburgers. The delicious fries! Refillable drink Price-quality very acceptable!Highly recommended!\n",
      "DO NOT THINK ABOUT IT ... VERY EXPENSIVE ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ .. WHAT THEY GIVE YOU DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE PRICES THEY CHARGE YOU .. THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OFFERED AND 30 MINUTES OF WAITING ... THE MISERABLE HABURGUESA. .A PIECE OF LETTUCE AND A PIECE OF TOMATO ... POTATOES WERE PURE SALT ... IN THE END, SEE THE PHOTOS ... HAVING GOOD ARTISAN BRANDS WHY GO TO THIS CHAIN? .. (BURGESA..TGB ... ETC ..)\n",
      "Burgers are one of the best I've had, a large selection of drinks with and without sugar, you pay as much as you like and drink freely. The service is fairly fast for the number of people in the restaurant. Delicious peanuts üòÅ\n",
      "The place is spacious and clean, but it is excessively expensive. The hamburger was really good, but I find it too expensive that you have to pay ‚Ç¨ 12 for a hamburger and a drink.I don't think I'll come back, it's still a burger shop of so many\n",
      "It seems a bit expensive ...\n",
      "Rich hamburgers, good attention. But that they only sell you Budweisser or Corona beer and at ‚Ç¨ 4, I think it's very bad. The burgers maybe a little small, but good taste.\n",
      "Our favorite üòçüòçüòçü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ amazing attention. The price is well above the US and Madrid itself, but ... what are we going to do. We change it for peanuts üòúüçîüçüüå≠\n",
      "Very good deal. They made the food in record time. The burgers are double meat. There are medium and large and all toppings are free. There is an area to serve ketchup and mayonnaise. Make less area to fill the drink on the second level.\n",
      "I love this place it's total american food ... For starters the fries are natural not frozen and they put you where they are from. The delicious burger the good meat and the delicious complements and they are free. While you wait you can eat free cacaotes !!!! And you have American or Mexican beers ... The prices are good and they are quick to serve, to go with ideal children ... You can not ask for more if you want to taste UUEE !!!! Five guys in the machinist !!!!\n",
      "Finally Barcelona has a Five Guys. We had already tried it sometime in NY and it never disappoints. The potatoes are the best, both normal and Cajun. Good burgers with better quality than other fast food chains. The negative point was taken by the shakes. They boast of having good shakes and the two we ordered tasted like cream and not oreo for example. They were totally white. I think this point should be improved.\n",
      "I have come because the hamburgers are super good as are the shakes, but today I tried the Bacon hot dog that is worth ‚Ç¨ 6.50 very expensive for how little and terrible it is. Horrible and disappointing. For now I would not return.\n",
      "A little expensive peeeeero ... the hamburger tastes like hamburger that is very important! Refillable drink!By the way those potatoes with coconut oil\n",
      "Simple and efficient menu, with fresh products, prices a little high, good\n",
      "Excellent service, incredible place, excellent hamburger, normal hamburger, 1 normal hamburger (double) and a small one, small potatoes and a soda with refill. ‚Ç¨ 23.50 peanuts are free.The real five guys experience, great service, great food, great decor, high prices, still worth it.\n",
      "The product is good but the format to eat there is terrible. In a bag, the potatoes in a glass and that makes it very stressful to eat like this\n",
      "Rich burgers and tasty potatoes (cooked with peanut oil). They have a stipulated price and then you can add all the ingredients you want from a list (such as grilled mushrooms, lettuce, onion, a variety of sauces, etc).Like the drink, if you decide on a soda, you have \"open bar\" and where to choose from more than 100 different ones üòÖThey have plus, free peanuts!\n",
      "Perhaps the quality / price ratio is not the most appropriate, for the price of the hamburger, without counting the drink or potatoes separately, we find other better options at La Maquinista. The quality of the burger is good. When paying for the drink, the possibility of refilling it more times is appreciated. Covid measures are well met, respecting spaces\n",
      "The best Fast Food of hamburgers. It's more expensive than the other Fast Food, but it's that they have hamburgers tastes and size hamburgers and some potatoes are much better than competition.\n",
      "For a fast food chain it has quality, the potatoes and hamburgers have nothing to do with those of MC Donald's or Burger King, that's the good thing, the bad thing is that it is very expensive since it does not have menus, you have to ask for things loose and only the hamburger already costs 7 euros, there is not much variety, only veal, no chicken. You can fill your drink as much as you want like in the Burger King\n",
      "Excellent attention. The hamburgers are excellent but if you eat little I recommend the mini ones, since the normal ones are with double thick meat and with that the price is already justified. If you also add all the ingredients, you will have a phenomenal hamburger !!. The potatoes are very good and with medium ones, it is enough for two people. You can fill your drink as many times as you want, so it is enough if you buy a glass when you go as a couple hahaha. It goes without saying that the price quality is worth it.\n",
      "Simply spectacular and brutal !! The burgers are great but you can also choose 12 different toppings and you can put them all at no additional cost! The soft drinks are refillable and have all the flavors you can imagine, Sprite strawberry flavor, etc. For me the best burger I have tasted in a long time. Brutal\n",
      "If you are a maverick rebel fed up with the hamburger monopoly of Mac Donald's and Burger King in Five Guys there is a corner for you.French fries in peanut oil, milkshakes with infinite complements and grilled hamburgers made as God intended, all wrapped in an informal and avant-garde atmosphere. If you go to Five Guys you will fall in love with the hamburger concept again.A bonus for those attentive and nice employees!\n",
      "Five Guys, American hamburger chain famous because the owner offers free peanuts while you wait for your hamburger, and also because the potatoes are fried with the oil of this fruit.The burgers are good but they are somewhat expensive:üçî ‚Ç¨ 5.75 Litle hamburguer.üçî 6'50 ‚Ç¨ \"Litle cheese hamburguer.üçü 3 ‚Ç¨ small potatoes.ü•§ ‚Ç¨ 3 Drink, you can serve yourself as many times as you like.I recommend üíØ%.\n",
      "Good burgers, as in the typical American movies that come out the burguers! recommendable\n",
      "What to say, you have to try it.\n",
      "Pretty good\n",
      "Super good, everything, you have drinks of all options, smoothies üòã great\n",
      "Everything is fine but a little expensive\n",
      "Very attentive and friendly staff, food served very fast and of quality. The drink machine is unique!\n",
      "The Cajun potatoes are delicious, and with the small measure, there is more than enough to be satisfied. As for the hamburger ... it leaves a lot to be desired for the price it has. You can put the ingredients you want for the same price, but I expected more flavor because of the restaurant's fame. Drinks of many different flavors and free peanuts are points in favor.I paid a total of ‚Ç¨ 13 for a small hamburger, small Cajun potatoes and drink.\n",
      "I went a few times in the other place of Sagrada Familia and the hamburger was much better than in this .... the potatoes buenissimas.\n",
      "Excellent attention, very good food, spacious and clean premises\n",
      "Good food and very attentive staff.\n",
      "Fresh meat, they do it at the moment, reasonable prior and real fries.\n",
      "The only good thing are the smoothies that are expensive and the flavored drinks ... the super simple burger ... and we are talking about a hamburger from 7 to 9 turkeys ..... over valued ... that's if the paws you pay for it aside ... you see preparing the cash chato ....\n",
      "The burger is not bad but nothing to get excited about, fast food style, very similar to the burger king, too expensive for what it is. The drink is also somewhat expensive, the Brooklyn beer 5 eurazos ...\n",
      "Fast Food Restaurant and Burgers\n",
      "Perfect hamburgers, you can add all the condiments they have completely free. The place complies with the regulatory sanitary regulations, it generates a lot of safety to eat inside the place. Refillable drink with many flavors that are not commonly tasted. Very friendly and outgoing employees. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "Authentic American hamburger, checked, we have visited in New York a Five Guy and then in Barcelona in the Machinist and I can tell you that the same, the taste, the presentation of the order, the decoration allüëç\n",
      "A very cool place to snack on something. Price quality.\n",
      "A bit expensive but the burgers are very good and you can choose from many toppings for her. A lot of variety of flavors in soft drinks such as coca cola, fanta, ...\n",
      "Oreo shake dog honeyPeanut burgers are delicious.\n",
      "The burger was very good and the potatoes too! There is a great variety of drinks and flavors that are not usually in Spain.\n",
      "The best burgers I've ever had. Juicy and with ingredients that show that they are fresh. Cajun potatoes are a must if you like spicy food and they are delicious. For soft drinks there are some \"Coca-Cola Freestyle\" machines where you choose the drink base (coca cola, Sprite, fanta, aquarius ...) and then the flavor (various fruits, vanilla). There is a flavor that is vanilla - cherry, which is the one I always take with coke. This is great. They also make smoothies and you have a peanut open bar !! In both hamburgers and shakes, you pay for the product you want and then you have free toppings from a list. In the hamburgers are onion, grilled onion, grilled mushrooms, pickles, jalape√±os (eye, fresh and crispy, not from a pot), relish (chopped pickles), tomato, lettuce, pepper, hot sauce, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, meat sauce ... And I don't know if I left something behind. In the shakes they are oreo, peanut butter and others that I can't remember. You can add cream Tb.Regarding the treatment, I have been like 10 times and it has always been exemplary. Very nice people who clarify any questions.It is a fast food place where you eat as you would at home if you were an expert in hamburgers.I plan to come back like 10,000 more times\n",
      "Reunion with the franchise estrwlla in the United States. Fast food of great quality although the price is a little higher than one would expect for eating fast food.\n",
      "Fast tasty, the price is worth better meat than the other hamburger franchises nearby.\n",
      "American food restaurant, burgers and potatoes are homemade, and you choose the ingredients.\n",
      "Excellent burguers. Very good\n",
      "Brutal burgers, amazing fries, and a soda machine with a ton of unexpected flavors. In short, Great !!!\n",
      "I highly recommend the meat of the unique hamburger, the guy who served us super friendly !!!\n",
      "I was going back to America for a while! Very friendly staff, and delicious food! Maybe I was expecting a cheaper movie! But it is worth it for the quantity of potatoes, quality of the meat and refillable drink. I hope they open in the city center !!\n",
      "The product is good and of quality, although given the fame, I expected more from the burgers. In my opinion the price is excessive.Clean premises, comply with the covid-19 protection measures.The friendly staff but I do not like that they constantly stop by your table to ask you if you want a smoothie or something else when you are calmly with your companion at your table.\n",
      "Sorry to say this a good site but we have stolen food at dinner, on the 2nd floor of the restaurant we stole a bag and responsible nor bothered to help or report the fact we had to go to mossos.\n",
      "To highlight the potatoes (of course) although it is necessary to advise in case of ordering them with Cajun species that they do not come up because it is really spicy. The chocolate peanut butter shake leaves me speechless every time I order it ...\n",
      "Expensive, but it eats well enough to be a fast food\n",
      "Fast and efficient service. It has a very sunny terrace to have breakfast or snacks. The offer is not very varied and the prices are quite high, but it is the best way to visit the museum or attend events and congresses without having to make long trips outside the premises.\n",
      "I can only comment as a cafeteria bar, although it is a restaurant and offers a la carte food. It is quite spacious, it has a large terrace. I had a queue to eat. It is a good place to have a cool drink after visiting the museum.\n",
      "Family restaurant to go with the kids without worrying.The food, good. The salad was NOT cool at all. Very successful hummus. The very rich Melos. The chocolate, walnut and banana cake .. mmmm ...\n",
      "The restaurant is located in the museum grounds, sharing space with the cafeteria. It is a bit noisy and there are usually quite a lot of people, the food was good. Something that I really liked and that I value is the vegetarian option, both in the first and in the second.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant to serve CosmoCaixa visitors. The space is huge and very well lit. The service is good and attentive. The prices are very adequate and the food is delicious! We have tried a sandwich, sweet pork, Russian salad and chocolate cake for dessert, all wonderful!\n",
      "Very correct food, well presented and very well cooked. Too bad that with COVID it only works 50% with a better distribution of the tables and with the immensity of space they have more people could enter. Highly recommended price-quality. To improve: more dishes to choose from on the menu. 4 first and 4 second is a fair hair.\n",
      "Consistent, tasty, well-organized and well-organized menu (starter, main course, drink and desserts). Good service and excellent value for money, I paid 13.95 euros for everything (a great value for Barcelona).\n",
      "Varied menu and good price. The letter is fine. So you don't have to complicate yourself looking for another place if you are going to spend the day .. a very nice deal ..\n",
      "The food was very good however, a camer ma told me it was smaller than my friend Joaquim and ma changed his paper cup for my glass cup, indignant. Pos date we have been 2 years.\n",
      "The service is unprofessional. Seasonal people, not waiters.\n",
      "Very nice restaurant, both space and staff, and high quality daily menu at a very fair price.\n",
      "Restaurant with Alma Bonita in the center of Barcelona\n",
      "The price is tight.The service is good.It's very clean.COVID measures are well followed.It has a large restaurant indoors and also has a terrace.The pity is that the menu is very small and the cheeseburger is quite improvable in quality of ingredients.Desserts could be cheaper (cheese cake).They have gluten-free and vegan food.\n",
      "I don't recommend it, and I'm talking about the cosmocaixa restaurant, eh? What below I have seen reviews with photographs that does not belong to this restaurant. The one in Cosmocaixa is worth nothing, we ask for a daily menu in which we order hummus, sweet pork and chocolate cake and on the other hand children's menu of macaroni and tomato ... Well the hummus (and look, I'm very humus) fatal, salty and honestly bad taste. The honeyed pork is saved, it could be eaten. The chocolate cake shows that it was not homemade so it was good. Let's talk about the children's menu, horrible! The children were spitting out that food and I am not surprised since I tasted it and it was sour, pasty, tasteless ... It says a lot about a cook who does not know how to make something as simple as macaroni. IM not coming back anymore.\n",
      "Seventh closed by the pandemic. You can bite into something in the cafeteria but ... it's nothing out of the ordinary.\n",
      "We had lunch on weekdays and found it a bit pricey.\n",
      "Well, what to say ........ Before it was an open buffet, of great quality and diversity. Now because of the pandemic, or so I think, it is menu and scarce and not very elaborate. We have had a problem with raw salmon ....... the treatment very well. But I do not recommend it. A shame\n",
      "Kind and hospitable. Great sandwiches. Very low prices: 2 large sandwiches (with ham and cheese, delicious) and 2 radlers, in total 10 euros.\n",
      "Clean, friendly treatment, delicious cuisine with good presentation. At an affordable price\n",
      "Quality-quantity-price, very good. 100% recommended for being a museum bar!\n",
      "Excellent attention, very organized, quality price very good\n",
      "The quick letter is very complete.The service, very good.I will repeat\n",

      "All right, fast food without ambition but good, delighted little ones.\n",
      "Excellent value for money! Tasty food, good service. Quick and attentive staff.\n",
      "Good service and quality food, only it would be nice to have more options on the menu\n",
      "Food on the terrace really good. Unbeatable value for money. We had a very small mishap and the boss (the guy with the beard) solved it perfectly. Enchanted. To always repeat.\n",
      "Unique environment. Great service. Excellent croquettes.\n",
      "Good price, good food, but you have to queue to enter and there is no possibility of reservation\n",
      "I have loved the food and the treatment. Price quality is fine. I recommend it.\n",

      "The space is very beautiful.\n",
      "Very good value for money. Fast and friendly service.\n",
      "A very cozy place\n",
      "Bad experience. Very bad organization when sitting down, food arrives cold and there are few staff. It should improve the quality of service.\n",
      "Highly recommended!\n",
      "Well organized, you eat well.\n",
      "Terrible attention, the man who treats us in a bad tone and with bad manners. The kitchen won't be open until 1:00 p.m., there are children who eat earlier than that and the offer before 1:00 p.m. unhealthy food cold sandwiches, donate yourself, pastries, potato chips ... if you can eat elsewhere or take your own own better.\n",
      "Good place to eat, it is within the Cosmocaixa enclosure\n",
      "Not recommended food\n",
      "Changes by Covid theme very well. Very correct price quality, even more so for Museum cafeteria.Friendly staff. Varied food offer. Brave potatoes that really are potatoes.\n",
      "Great service, all excellent.\n",
      "Restaurant inside the museum.The price a bit high.\n",
      "Very good AI menu at a very affordable price\n",
      "The menu and food for children is very good\n",
      "Very well attended, and the menu, well presented and everything very good. I'll be back when I can.\n",
      "To have a drink and order a tapa is fine. But eating leaves a lot to be desired. I have ordered the quinoa salad and I have not been able to eat it. The macaroni also very fair.\n",
      "Good sandwiches and very successful children's dishes! Very familiar place and very affordable prices.\n",
      "Menu with a good quality price\n",
      "In the adult menu, there is not much to choose from: and the child's lettuce does not go through a health check, it had been recommended to me, but I really did not like it very much.\n",
      "Very correct good service\n",
      "Excellent cafeteria\n",
      "Barely enough restaurant due to covid restrictions\n",
      "We were thinking of having a coke and some potatoes, but we stayed to eat because the prices were very good.Very good food and generous portions. We did not expect much because it was very cheap, but we left very happy because it meets the 3 Bs: Good, Nice and Cheap! Also very friendly waiters\n",
      "They take advantage of tourism a bit, they are expensive.\n",
      "Very friendly staff\n",
      "The truth, I was very surprised. It has quite generous portions and my children have really enjoyed the food. It is worth coming here, apart from seeing a super cool museum you eat very well and have a very good service\n",
      "Value for money very well, they have a free buffet that is very good and varied. For ‚Ç¨ 14 I do not know what people expect, I think that more attention, which is excellent, earns a good grade. There is something on the menu such as Andalusian squid (real squid) that were very good. If I return to the museum I will repeat. I recommend it.\n",
      "A good place to eat when visiting Cosmocaixa. Buffet service, with good salads and more than acceptable second courses. Good service and reasonable price. The place is large and spacious, there is room for happiness to move around and go for food.\n",
      "Bufete flowing, with few things. It's the 3rd time I went there and it's lost in quality and quantity. To continue visiting the museum and eat something na is okay. Very correct service\n",
      "There is no letter to see prices, what less a qr code on the table to know what you pay, right? No chocolate croissant left :(.\n",
      "Reasonable price (much cheaper than downtown)Good tasteSweet fruitDrinking with waterDo not understand why the evaluation is not very high\n",
      "Good value for money, considering that it is a place full of families with children, they have a sufficiently complete self-service meal offering and different options so that children do not eat the usual children's menu (escalope with chips). Efficient service, too much even if you get the dish without finishing if you mess up!\n",
      "Quality very good price\n",
      "Passable food and limited assortment but, honestly, considering the null offer that there is for the surroundings and the prices of the cafeteria it is worth eating there. The staff is friendly and the place is comfortable and they were kind enough to adapt the prices to the ages of my daughters. The little girl of two years did not pay and the one of 4 only half something that is to be appreciated.At another time of the year where the heat is not so stifling it is worth going to the picnic area when visiting the museum\n",

      "The truth is that the buffet food is bad. I'm sorry because they are workers who are there to give the service. But pay almost 15 euros and find refried potatoes and hard raw fideua. The food I'm sorry but it has no quality to charge you what they charge you. We've gone 3 times to eat and it's just the same. Bad kitchen. Desserts are saved and salad theme ... everything else leaves much to be desired It is not well cooked. It is clear that it is better that you take something to eat picinic d.At least we do not repeat.\n",

      "Buffet restaurant: The only good thing is the attention and the coffee. Unfortunate food in all areas, from cold starters to hot ones, passing through the children's. There was nothing to save, not even the price or the space. Eat anywhere else and you will be right.\n",
      "I did not like it at all, I do not recommend that you go very bad service.\n",

      "Very good Mexican food restaurant. We have tried various dishes (nachos, tacos, enchilada, and quesadillas) and they were all very good. The sauces are delicious and from what we have been told they are homemade, one more point in favor. In addition, both the boy and the girl have been very kind and attentive at all times. Quality - average price. We will repeat for sure!\n",

      "Spectacular Mexican, it is easy to recognize in their dishes the love and passion with which they prepare their dishes, the details, their presentation and the mixture of flavors make the Tarantula a totally differentiating Mexican.We have much left to try ... especially those super desserts so elaborate but we couldn't do it anymore, so ...... WE WILL BE BACK WITHOUT DOUBT!\n",
      "Simply delicious. A joy.We enjoyed some of their classic dishes on the menu such as the carnitas tacos, sublime; the governor's tacos, pure fried with red shrimp; the nachos Oaxaquiles, spectacular ... We also tried a couple of off-the-menu options. A beet mole with Iberian prey that was crazy. And the preparation they have available for the cal√ßots route, a cal√ßot pipi√°n for dipping bread.The desserts, the perfect finish. Artesanales, a typically Mexican caf√© de la olla, Tarta tres leches and a Brownie with chocolate and chili topping.Impeccable service.\n",
      "Very good restaurant, we went there with my family who lives in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwe live in Murcia and we went on vacation and the place is wonderful, there is everything Mexican üá≤üáΩ, I loved the Quesadilla with mushrooms and cheese. Very good! üëè\n",

      "A place with a good atmosphere of course, I do not recommend you go at times when they are full since they are quite saturated, the food may not really be to my taste but it did not serve meat that had flavor, sorry guys but I will not return\n",
      "The classics are very good but if you want to be surprised, ask for the off-the-menu dishes or the specials. The Michelada is very good.\n",
      "After the nachos with melted Manchego cheese (or over there), the bland tacos with the meat most likely from the boat, I don't know what to say. They don't give you a sauce, you have to ask for a lime.For the price it has, I have not been convinced.A couple of years ago it seems that the owners were Mexican. They had a slightly run down place, but food made with love. Now the walls are fixed but bland ...\n",
      "Very good food, the quesadillas the best. Good quality / price ratio and excellent service!\n",

      "A festival !! It‚Äôs hard for me to say if I liked what we ate better, how we were treated, or the professionalism of Sandra and Albert‚Äôs speed and friendliness.The quality of the raw material is unbeatable and the treatment that Albert gives them creates dishes with excellent flavors, textures and smells that are a gift to the senses.Kindness and speed make it a wonderful experience.Thanks for the evening, very very happy to have had dinner at the tarantula üåµüåµüåµ\n",

Food with a very good presentation, tasty and made with great care.We will be back for sure! We did not take photos because there was no time, we ate it as soon as it was served to the table. Sometimes it pays to skip that step to enjoy the moment.\n",
      "Great food and excellent service. Almost the entire menu is gluten free.\n",
      "Very good. Very good, homemade Mexican cuisine. Menu dishes and always with something different off the menu.Recommended 100%\n",
      "It is not the first time I go and every time I am surprised again by how good it is. The food is exquisite, the micheladas are perfect. Almost almost as if you were eating in the very center of Mexico City, with the only difference that there a taco costs 7 pesos. The price is completely according to its quality, also the waiter (and I don't know if the owner) is very nice and friendly and if you ask him he explains the ingredients of the dishes without problem. I RECOMMEND that you try the spicy green sauce (which is not very spicy) and the cheesecake that is BRUTAL. We will repeat !!\n",
      "Excellent attention more on these dates\n",
      "Varied menu, good service. Some dishes lack a bit of flavor. Craft beer from the neighborhood.\n",
      "Brutal! This is another level, the champions. You can see the good work and dedication they put into their dishes. You can see that the raw material is excellent. To enjoy Mexican food, this is the place. I totally recommend it.\n",

      "Very nice Mexican with a lot of flavor and very elaborate.\n",
      "Before the pandemic we went a lot: large, good portions and a good price ...Yesterday we went again after a long time and, I don't know if they have changed owners or something, but the portions are much smaller and the price is higher.It feels very bad to us because we know the work behind it and what the pandemic has done ... But we, the clients, are not to blame.\n",

      "They are still very good cooks, but the menu is becoming more concise, the portions also, and the prices the opposite. Authentic Mexican cuisine, yes\n",
      "Spectacular tasting for the gastronomic days of Sants.Do not miss it!!\n",
      "Highly and highly recommended. Get advice from the owner. Very attentive service.\n",

      "Spectacular restaurant and super friendly service.\n",
      "Really Mexican quality food with impeccable service. Authentic flavors, a varied menu and a good assortment of beers and cocktails! Change in the management of the restaurant that has undoubtedly taken a turn in the right direction !! A very good choice for lunch or dinner in Sants !!\n",
      "The menu is very tasty and varied. From another world the care we receive, it is good to know that in the neighborhood there are people who do things well and make you feel at home\n",
      "Food terrible, tasteless, unseasoned, very small portions. I do not recommend.\n",
      "Interesting, the treatment is cordial and the nachos are good, we will return to try more things.\n",
      "Excellent everything, .... And the dessert üç∞ yummy, .... Exquisite ...\n",
      "The food is very tasty, although the amount of food has varied and there is less, for example the nachos. The cook and waitress are very friendly. It took them almost half an hour to attend us just for drinks and from aperitif to lunch another half hour, we were no longer hungry, the service was quite slow.\n",
      "Excellent food, brutal tacos and carnitas. Delicious michelada and exceptional service. Very nice waitress and she has given us recommendations. We will be back\n",
      "Delicious Mexican food. Super recommended.\n",
      "A very fast and efficient treatment. Great food, even better value for money. I went to dinner with 5 friends, we decided to order together to share and thus try more things and each one more delicious.Highly recommended! Peaceful place.\n",
      "I do not know how to organize much since they did not expect to work the night of San Juan. The food was good, but just as good I can do it. Good quantities, yes, and the chocolate cake too big. The new cook from three weeks ago very nice. Reasonable and affordable price.\n",
      "The food is quite good but the price seems outrageous ... a quesadilla that is 2 wheat tortillas with cheese and mushrooms that you make at home 10.50eur! Some very rare taquitos of meat with sauce according to them of a thousand species and peanuts with 3 mini pancakes of tacos 14 eur! ... no matter how much they want to sell you that it is good raw material, it does not justify that amount. Some simple nachos with cheese 7.50! Once and no more .... I will not return. The terrace in the middle of the road without putting a sad cane separation, tables without trivets or decoration.To pay 31 eur per person seems to me little surprising in general. The good reviews will be from friends because he is just another Mexican.The restaurant's response to my review does not make sense ... one thing is that you see the price of 14 eur on the menu for a plate and another is that you know that they are going to put a ridiculous amount of meat taquitos that does not cover or the bottom of the pan. And yes, we could have gone to see the \"terrace\" worse at that time and coming from the other end of the city difficult to find another option.\n",
      "Good treatment and very good food\n",
      "This is a place to come to eat well. With the new owner, he has made a leap of bestial quality and they make a first-class Mexican cuisine. To the fans of the old tarantula, just tell them that the portions are still large, but now everything is much richer (and yes, there is still that dessert deed called Resurrection for chocolate). You can tell they know what they do, the pampering in each sauce, in the explanation of each dish. And now open at noon!\n",
      "Totally recommendable. Very good quality Mexican food, tasty and the margaritas very well prepared.Likewise, the waitress was very attentive, explaining each dish and giving a very personal treatment.\n",
      "Great restaurant! Team made up of great professionals where you can tell that cooking is their vocation. We let ourselves be advised by the chef and the truth was that we were able to enjoy good Mexican cuisine. Without a doubt, we will continue testing the rest of the menu! Recommended 100%, thanks for being!\n",
      "Everything is fantastic from the service to the food including the dessert, especially the \"three milks\". If you like Mexican food you have to try it.\n",
      "One more Mexican restaurant and how these the portions are scarce and the prices high. The food is good and the premises are clean.We have paid 25 euros each (three girls and I) and had to repeat nachos due to the small amount of the portions. Still we have left hungry. We made the reservation before knowing about the new management, we thought there would be something left of that and not. Another thing that they would have to take care of are the \"fingers\" on the edges of the plates. We will not cross Barcelona again to go to this place since, as I say at the beginning, it is one of the many Mexicans that populate Barcelona.\n",
      "Very good food, nice restaurant, quantity ok, Jamaican waters good. It is a restaurant that can pass a wheelchair or cart.\n",
      "Excellent. We called to order dinner and let ourselves be advised. All very good, highly recommended if you like spicy.\n",
      "All very good\n",
      "Very good Mexican restaurant, you can see that they love everything they do!\n",
      "Homemade Mexican food the best of Sants for me. Camerera ensures a great service. Thanks.\n",
      "The food is good and the best thing is that they have mezcal!\n",
      "Totally recommended, it was the first time we went, they recommended dishes off the menu, they were very good, the tacos \"carnitas\" brutal. Very attentive staff. We will certainly repeat.\n",
      "He had been to the previous Tarantula before. Nothing to see. Far from the large and greasy portions, the current proposal has a very tasty cuisine, just spicy and very authentic and rich Mexican food ... üòç\n",
      "Excellent treatment and good cuisine.Large portions, with quality ingredients and careful preparation.\n",
      "Very tasty food, it is not cheap but I would say that it is within the normal range, of quality. The super nice owners put a lot of love on it and it shows!\n",
      "On Saturday we were having lunch at the Tarantula with some friends. The reception was very good and fast, we arrived early, but they already had the table ready, so they let us sit long before the time we had booked. They recommended dishes from the menu, and advised us the amount according to the people we were. Exquisite food, especially the \"totopos\" and the \"quesadilla\" of mushrooms !!!The visit has been more than excellent, I will repeat for sure and very soon.\n",
      "Incredible burritos! Very very good. And the creamy coffee is a very good idea. Let's see what happens next time, because we'll be back\n",
      "We ordered the enchiladas suizas and the tacos de cochinita and everything was great and with a lot of flavor!The tres leches cake and the caf√© de olla dessert are spectacular.We will be back\n",
      "The restaurant spectacular the impeccable attention, the chef came to the table on two occasions to ask how it was and the spiciness of the tacos a mere Mexican. Thank youRecommended one hundred percent thank you guys\n",
      "Quite disappointing, low quality food and expensively priced. The cheese in the enchilada was pot and the veal with vegetables was hard and tasteless. A disappointment. A few years ago it was worth eating in this restaurant, but now it is not ...\n",
      "Great food, high quality ingredients and super nice staff\n",
      "A good place to enjoy Mexican food, good atmosphere ... and we will be back!\n",
      "We grabbed food to take away. All super. Excellent care. And very good food !!\n",
      "Best Mexican restaurant I've ever gone to. Quality / price balanced, the dishes are very forceful, and with generous quantities. Star dish the \"super mixed fajites\" and the dessert \"resurrecci√≥n por chocolate\" is very good and huge. Dishes to share. Highly recommended. 10/10. Helpful and very friendly treatment.\n",
      "Very expensive for what it is.Personally, I did not like the enmoladas because the chicken seems only boiled without seasonings (without flavor) and the mole with a very bitter taste. And the divorced enchiladas looked like they brought the same tasteless chicken as the enmoladas.What I did like were the nachos with yellow cheese and avocado and the brownie dessert with spicy chocolate.\n",
      "New shaded terrace for iced coffee.\n",
      "EDIT: If I just don't have previous reviews it's because I don't like to complain about food in general, food is food and I don't like saying anything. But now we are going to put it on a tray. On top of giving lousy food, arrogant people.I went to this \"Mexican\" almost a month ago with a friend. The friendly waitress, that's good. But come on, in general, the three things that could go wrong, this site had them: EXPENSIVE, POOR QUALITY and LOW QUANTITY.The nachos already first, seemed bag, shabby presentation. The quesadillas, cutr√≠simas, cheese or melted. And the pastor tacos with pineapple already killed us, all super little compact, the pineapple (possibly from a boat), the onion ... it fell everywhere and the rancid meat and thick chunks that looked like skewers from Mercadona. Then, price, between two people almost 50 euros. Our face was a poem.The worst thing is that we ended up hungry, and we went to eat a giant donut.Gentlemen, not all of us in BCN are tourists, and many of us have been to Mexicans before. This is the worst we've been to by far.In short, the food could be eaten? Yes. But not at those prices. Either you make it cheap or you give it quality. But you can't charge what you charge for that.So nothing, do you want a review? There you have it, have a good day!EDIT 2: For those who do not know, the original message from the place said that my account was fake, simply for putting a star and not writing a comment. When reading such an arrogant message, I have decided to explain my experience with hair and signs and now they have edited their answer as well. It is seen that internet reviews are only valid when they are positive.\n",
      "Without a doubt, I will repeat. Exquisite food, well prepared and with top quality ingredients. The perfect care too. A place where you can go perfectly with friends, family or partner.\n",
      "Very good restaurant with traditional Mexican cuisine,the attention is wonderful and respect for the product too, plus every month they make a different mole with their main dish, I will not hesitate to return!\n",
      "We were a group of 8 people a few months ago, a very cozy and 100% recommended place, with a really very affordable price. They guided us with the quantities, with the dishes. They helped us with the desserts, they were friendly, attentive ... They served us with a smile at all times. Happy Holidays. We will repeat !!!\n",

      "Excellent Mexican cuisine, if you like cochinita pibil do not hesitate to visit them, all excellent, pastor tacos, chicken tacos, cold beer. As a good Mexican restaurant, if you want to try everything, it takes money and for those who love spicy, don't forget to order it separately, the dishes don't have it. For me, five stars I don't give them üåÆüåÆüåÆüåÆüåÆ five tacos üôÇ\n",

I first saw that the chef was a foreigner, and I was worried about the taste, but the first wonton that came up was conquered. For me, I was surprised to add shrimp skins and the soup was very fresh. The fried noodles that followed were amazing and tasted like domestic ones. We also ordered Xiaolongbao and finished these quickly. My companion and I felt unfulfilled. I added a fried noodles, and now I decided to spend the next few days in Barcelona and want to eat everything in the store. I highly recommend it to everyone. Now I am satisfied. I am not tired from walking. I feel happy as a whole. The picture is a proof. Later, I couldn‚Äôt put down a table and put other empty plates on the next table. I ate so many things. I was scared by myself\n",

I can say that it is the best ramen I have tasted by far (and having tried ramen from high class restaurants) the customer service is exquisite, I have no complaints from the two waitresses, they have always been professionals and have given a good deal, good atmosphere, it is a small place but that makes it more charming. The only \"complaint\" is that before the ramen was at 6'95 and now they have raised it to 7'95, which makes it lose some prestige around the other places, but I suppose that the price increase goes from the hand that that dish triumphs.\n",

      "A Lebanese with a special charm, a place that is worth seeing and eating, a place with a history of more than 38 years, a place that after so many years continues to shine and continues to have the same quality and essence as always.I am a lifelong customer and it is amazing how they continue to cook each and every one of their dishes with the best flavors in the world.Abou Khalil's Jaima has taken a 360 degree turn with his facelift and his new way of showing the public his delicacies.They have opted for a tapas format at a brutal price.The owner continues to be the soul of the restaurant, a man who is a pleasure to talk to and above all who will always recommend you in the best way and with all his affection, you can see the love he has for this business, and that is why he continues to triumph afterwards. He is almost 38 years old. Mr. Miguel is fantastic, we love him.You all have to try Este Liban√©s, undoubtedly the best in Spain.We will repeat a thousand times more.You deserve all the success in the world.\n",
      "All delicious. A very attentive staff and willing to help you, in terms of the best choice according to your preferences.Very good value for money. We will be back without a doubt !!\n",

Out of 10, to each dish they explained their why and their what .... we repeat and suggest INSURANCE. Thanks Miguel and company. üôåüèΩ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n",

      "Food is not bad, but the smell of tobacco and smoke is quite unbearable, I do not understand that you can smoke indoors.\n",
      "Very good place to eat Lebanese food in Barcelona. We ordered hummus, very rich, falafel, with a very particular touch, accompanied by a sauce with tahini, kibe and tabuleh, which was fantastic and very well seasoned. We also ordered a lamb swarma that has nothing to do with the fast food Kebab that have become fashionable now. With grilled sliced ‚Äã‚Äãlamb, very rich and aromatic. For dessert they had Lebanese sweets and we asked, they were very good, with their honey and nuts. The site is highly recommended.\n",
      "Brilliant! Very charming place, with a great tradition in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãexcellent food and absolute friendliness of the waiter!\n",

      "We have gone to dinner with my wife in our wedding anniversary celebration and we have been delighted with the service and the quality of their dishes and products.We have really been able to taste different dishes of Lebanese cuisine with a personalized and friendly treatment.The value for money is excellent and the atmosphere is unbeatable.I definitely recommend Al Jaima. We will repeat again.\n",
      "As always, a great experience to eat at this great place. Both the quality of the food and the attention of the staff are excellent. Congratulations on such an exceptional restaurant. In my opinion, one of the sites that offer the best quality-price-quantity ratio in Barcelona.\n",
      "All very authentic, very rich in flavor, hummus, tabboule, aubergine cream and shawarma was to die for, very tender butter very rich in flavor. Top. We will be back üëè\n",
      "We had a great time. Special note for the shisha, best shisha of the 4 restaurants we have eaten in Barcelona. We strongly RECOMMEND\n",
      "I went to dinner yesterday with some friends and the experience was extraordinary! We were advised by Alex and all his proposals were delicious. Don't miss out on the great hummus! Without a doubt one of the best in Barcelona :) We will repeat without a doubt!\n",
      "We were 6 people and although they did not have a tasting menu for 6, they proposed to do it for 4 and they included several more dishes. The place is very nice, the staff nice and the food delicious, we were very full. Good value for money.\n",
      "Top, delicious!\n",
      "Good food at an affordable price. The waiters are very good\n",

      "Very good Lebanese restaurant. Food, attention and decoration. And location. To go\n",
      "Although with a small step at the entrance, you can enter in a wheelchair and then it is well adapted. High tables where the legs fit comfortably. Noon menu 11'5 with a great variety of first and second, some very rich black olives of starter detail. Vegetable and chickpea mussaka very rich, baked lamb with rice and nuts was good, but later with spicy (it is requested separately but they do not charge it) even better (very spicy, watch out !!). Typical desserts of nuts, honey and very good puff pastry. Very friendly and attentive waiter. Spacious and pleasant place. So, conclusion, Recommended !!\n",
      "First time in a Lebanese. I advise asking for the tasting menu to share between 2 people. It is all vegetable. Varied and rich. Good deal and correct price\n",
      "The interior is super nice and the food was great. They have recommended us dishes and we have accepted the suggestions ... 100% satisfied !!

      "If you are not an expert in Lebanese food it is quite good. The food is rich and the decoration of the place is quite genuine, better than the other restaurant in the chain. For my taste, some dishes are quite inflated. Falafel highly recommended. The hummus, personally, I did not like very much, very dense and almost tasteless, but it was not inedible either, just a hummus without pain or glory.\n",
      "Good food and attention, I would always repeat that I can at a good price.\n",
      "Delicious food, I recommend the shawarma sandwiches and hummus, also the service is super attentive and they have treated us phenomenally. We will repeat for sure!\n",

      "The best Lebanese restaurant I have eaten in so far. Everything was great. For twenty-eight euros you have a tasting option more than enough for two people that includes twelve dishes. Come on, you can eat like a king for just over fifteen euros per person. The waiter was very friendly and explained everything to us. The truth is that I have no complaints. I will be back for sure.\n",
      "Delicious dishes. Impeccable customer service and attention.Impeccable decoration of the premises.Totally recommendable.\n",

      "Excellent Lebanese food! We loved it. If you are looking for a restaurant with authentic Lebanese food, this is definitely the restaurant.

We will return without hesitation.\n",
      "Spectacular Lebanese restaurant, with the best menu in Barcelona at an unbeatable price. Quality and impeccable service from friendly and very friendly professionals. The owner is a connoisseur of good food that has spent half his life making us enjoy it in Barcelona.\n",
      "Excellent food and price, but the best, without a doubt, the treatment. My 8-year-old daughter is a super fan of the master chef, a contest in which the owner's son was, got to know his family and make a video call with him. They are great, the family and the staff.\n",

      "Nice staff attention and support, clean place and good mix grill for 4 nice selection with about 100 ERNice place needs a little walk, the staff is good handling, the meal is good and the place is sweet\n",
      "First experience of Lebanese cuisine and definitely not the last\n",
      "The reform has done the restaurant very well. Now it is much more welcoming. The menu is more complete and adjusted in quantity and price. I recommend taking the advice of the maitre d ', very expert and friendly, who quickly takes care of the client's wishes. The Lebanese experience is a delight\n",
      "Delicious, super recommended. It has a large number of dishes (also vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free, apart from meat, fish and rice), the price is adequate. I recommend ordering single plates or the mazza (tasting of 12 typical dishes), don't forget to order dessert! Everything is homemade.\n",
      "Very beautiful settingPersonal welcoming and it's very good\n",
      "Very good lamb and excellent attention !! It's nice to find such places. We will repeat for sure\n",

      "Quality Lebanese cuisine that is very tasty and well-crafted. Great choice\n",
      "In general correct .. We expected much more flavor in the dishes especially in the hummus that lacked consistency. Small servings. What is not received is that they nail you 5 euros for the Lebanese Caf√®\n",
      "A spectacular meal (I dream of the Kawarma) and a very pleasant customer service. It is the first time that we come to the renovated premises, a delight and I hit the decoration! We have also tried some of the new dishes on the menu (very good), but we have saved some for the next visit, which we will soon do.\n",
      "Very good Lebanese restaurant. We really liked the atmosphere and also the food. They advised us, since it was the first time we were going and, in addition, the price is very good. We will be back\n",
      "Very good food, recently renovated space with great taste that make it a cozy and modern place, and always very attentive service!

      "Delicious and very good price\n",
      "I have loved it, super homemade and tasty food! For dessert the Knafe is DELICIOUS! We have eaten the tasting, all very tasty. And to finish the typical mint tea, very good. The owner is a charm, and you feel in another country but like home, we will return! Thanks!\n",
      "All very well. Quality food, elegant decor, and attentive, friendly service. We will repeat :)\n",
      "Very good service and very good traditional Lebanese dishes, especially falafel and hummus. Good price but a little small plates.\n",
      "Very good service and excellent food\n",
      "A SPECTACULAR restaurant for both the food and the treatment. The owner and the waiter are super friendly and very friendly.There is an option on the menu where they offer 12 typical Lebanese dishes, which one is better.After eating we had dessert with a shisha (very good too).Beautiful, renovated and very clean premises. 100% recommendable.See you soon for sure !!!\n",
      "A magical space in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãimpossible to stop going once a week, for the food and the human quality of the team.Recently renovated with a fresh and modern touch.A place that you cannot miss if you pass through the Eixample.\n",

      "The best hummus in Barcelona ... The best Lebanese mussaka in Europe ..\n",
      "Simply spectacular! Very familiar attention and excellent food. We will be back for sure!\n",
      "Spectacular Lebanese food!One of the best falafel in barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwith an authentic tahini, a kibbe that amazes you.The spectacular service attended by its owners with great affection.100% recommended!!!!!\n",
      "The food is spectacular, the tasting menu is highly recommended. All the staff is very friendly and friendly, very good atmosphere\n",
      "The dishes in general are rich. The best are the bravas, which has a very good contrast between the light foam and a spicier sauce in the center. It seems small but it is deceiving; fills up a lot. This dish is really delicious.The low-temperature egg is delicious, although for my taste it lacked something else to dip like a good piece of bread. I found the rice with eel strong in flavor; especially eel.When ordering the desserts we had a new waitress who did not explain to us that the cheese cake has blue cheese and that it is very strong in flavor. I hate blue cheese and strong cheeses in general, so I had a very generous portion and as soon as I felt the flavor so strong and specific, it almost gave me something of how bad it tasted! The taste did not go away no matter how much I drank water. We had ordered at least two desserts and I was able to eat the French toast, which is very tasty. Of course it all depends on the taste of each one; Anyone who likes super strong cheese will love this cheesecake.\n",
      "An ideal place to eat good original tapas, made with a quality product. The attention of the very correct staff and very attentive at all times.The 3 desserts we ordered were delicious, but the torrija one was spectacular.A 100% recommended site.\n",
      "Tapas restaurant by Jordi Cruz. High quality dishes and a very good product. We loved each and every one of the dishes we ordered, we even repeated some.100% recommended to come to eat. Another option is the tasting menu which is brutal.The place is very modern and beautiful, with excellent service.\n",
      "Great dining experience. The dishes were quite good, original and of acceptable quantity. The dessert, 'pink panter', from another world.Perhaps the prices are somewhat high. When I went, the bathrooms weren't very clean, I don't know if this will be usual.\n",
      "Personally it has been a very good experience. We have made the tasting menu and everything was very very tasty. For me, a good price / quality ratio. Apart from the tasting menu, we have taken the tapa of bravas, we wanted to try them. Super recommended !! The pity has been that they have forgotten to wear the petit four ... but hey, that will not lower the score either, it would not be fair\n",
      "Tasting menu of 10. Incredibly friendly staff. Very good experience.\n",
      "Fresh and good quality products, original dishes. The style is tapas, not single-dish, which is just what we wanted. They also have a tasting menu.We loved it and for a more than fair price of ‚Ç¨ 30 / pers. we left full. Good atmosphere also for couples.I recommend the curry and lamb brioix, the dogfish and the cream ninyoyaki.\n",
      "We arrived at the restaurant with high expectations after trying Abac and being followers of Jordi's cuisine.The place is quite simple.Average food ... We didn't find that rock and roll defined.Very basic service, very very basic.And to top it off we had to change tables because of flies ... This left us speechless.A disappointment\n",
      "I chose a tasting menu for my partner's birthday present. She was delighted. It allows you to try Jordi Cruz's cuisine at a reasonable price.\n",
      "Adequate price quality tasting menu. Very attentive table service.\n",
      "Very good tasting menu, exquisite attention, good quality / price ratio.\n",
      "Good service and quality of products. Limited variety and somewhat high prices for the amount they serve. Nice place. Good option if you want to try something by Jordi Cruz.\n",
      "I was with my wife last Thursday. Impressive. We ordered the tasting menu and it was all delicious. We loved the tempo and progression of the dishes. The extraordinary staff. We did not have time to recommend it! We will be back.\n",
      "Rich and well prepared tapas. The very rich dogfish as well as the eel rice. Totally recommendable.\n",
      "All very good, Jordi Cruz does not fail and the attention is very good ... We will repeat.\n",
      "Ufff, very successful, taste and quality, of course attention and cleanliness, remarkable high\n",
      "Regrettable. After booking indicating an allergy to nuts, upon arrival they confirmed that they had the information and asked us extensively the level of the allergy. After this they clearly indicated that the tasting menu would have some change. At the time of the desserts, they served us a dish that luckily we knew and that had almonds among its ingredients. They changed us for a fruit salad with ice cream thanks to the fact that we told them otherwise ... To top it off in the petits fours they again offered us some chocolates with nuts ... This time at least they apologized.\n",
      "Restaurant to discover very elaborate and exquisite tapas, impeccable staff treatment, quiet and pleasant place.We will repeat\n",
      "Affordable price, variety of tapas made with great taste.\n",
      "STAR FOOD AND MCDONALDS SERVICEThe food is spectacular. We ordered several tapas and portions to share. It was all great and not badly priced. That is if the service DEPLORABLE, from Mcdonalds (but at the price of a Restaurant). We ate on the terrace. I list the things we didn't like regarding the service:No tablecloth, no underplate or anything on the table.We were served by 4 different waiters (I have never seen it in this type of restaurant)We ate on the terrace and in the place next door they had loud music, tremendously annoying.The waiters did not stop by the table other than to take orders and bring the food. At no time did they ask us what we were like, nor did they explain anything about the menu, nor did they explain what dish they brought ...We ordered a few tapas and portions to share. First they brought us the oysters, then two tapas (we had ordered 3), and after about 10 minutes they brought us the rest of the dishes (6 in total) all at once. At this moment, a lot of dishes were gathered on the table, without any order or sense since after 5 minutes many of the dishes were cold.In my opinion and that of my companions, all regulars of restaurants of this type, the service and the small details completely spoil the experience, preventing you from enjoying such delicious dishes. We did not understand the concept of \"Restaurant\". I quote it because the service seemed more like a bar to have a few beers with colleagues than a restaurant.The truth is that it is a shame that in a place with such a high level of cuisine, which bears the name of a chef with 3 Michelin stars, they have such seedy service and so little attention is paid to details.\n",
      "Everything was incredible, we made the tasting menu, you can see the stamp of Jordi Cruz. We will be back.\n",
      "A pleasant surprise. Jordi Cruz's stamp is already a guaranteeNice place located in El BornDelicious tasting menu at a great price. Authentic and very efficient service. Young people .\n",
      "Very good. Very attentive service. The tasting menu is perfect, even too much for me .. ü§£ü§£\n",
      "Tomamoa tasting menu, it was good although the two desserts were very similar, the dish stands out, which is an incredible egg, the rest does not seem to me to stand out at all. It was good value for money.\n",
      "I loved it, the Tasting Menu is impressive, everything is great and each dish surprises you.\n",
      "Spectacular tapas, creative cuisine and with a very good attention from all the room staff. It really was a very pleasant visit.\n",
      "Bittersweet feeling after making the tasting menu. Very good dishes, from the first to the last, but in our opinion the service left a lot to be desired. They brought the dishes to the table without giving any explanation. Also, when we were going for dessert, around 4.15pm, all the waiters disappeared from the room, only the girl from the bar (who is in another separate space) remained. We had to get up to order the last dish as no one brought it to us nor did they come to ask if we wanted coffee. When it came to paying we also had to get up to ask where we needed to go. A service little to match a restaurant of this category.\n",
      "Very elaborate tapas cuisine with good service\n",
      "Spectacular! My husband has given me a tasting menu for my 40th birthday and the truth is that I am delighted. The food is good, no, the following, the staff are super attentive and aware that the dishes comply with my dietary restrictions (allergy to nuts). We have loved everything, the mixture of flavors, the explanations and the rhythm at which the dishes are coming out that makes you come out more than satisfied (in my case very full). The place is small but charming. After trying the tasting menu, we will surely repeat some of the tapas that we have eaten today. After trying the food, it is not surprising that Jordi Cruz has 6 Michelin stars.\n",
      "Exquisite tasting menu. I recommend it.\n",
      "The place is very cool decorated, very modern. The way to place your order is through mobile, very practical. The burgers are sooo good, of a good size, maybe a bit done, the brioche bread very soft, with a very good sweet spot. Fries with parmesan very good. We will repeat for sure.\n",
      "A very good quality hamburger restaurant, with a concept somewhat different from the others.The order system is good; however I find it somewhat complex for someone who comes without a mobile or a foreigner without access to data.I think the bar has a chance, since it is not interesting to sit for a long time, however they sell the concept as slow food ... that does not make much sense.Last point, they should consider a children's menu, since the simple hamburger for a child is simply huge to eat. With that, families could also come and not just people without children.I hope the comments serve you and keep cooking good burgers!\n",
      "Pure fat! I liked it a lot, it is one of the best burgers I have eaten in BCN. Especially the BBQ\n",
      "Good hamburger, even better fries and a very cool place, but without a doubt the best thing about Vicio is its marketing and social media management. Very good work from the entire team that is in charge of advertising and social media.\n",
      "Brutal truth, we got the combo of 2 burgers and the combo of 1 and incredibleThe potato servings are large and the dessert is huge (perfectly for 2 people)In my case I caught PREMIUM Truffled Cheeseburger and it was ...... you have to try it;)PS the photos came out like this because of the red neons of the premises. Once inside they explain how to order (take away style)\n",
      "It's worth queuing to get in for a burger.The place is an experience, the kitchen completely in view and the atmosphere, music and everything.Another roll. Worth trying.Very tasty smash burgers and very tender wings.The photos are not the best but it is that with the light of the disco type place I have not gotten better haha.\n",
      "He catches me next to the office, and I had to go. The value for money is very good. The place draws a lot of attention, although there is not much room (if you come with a scooter you can fold it under your seat). You ask through a QR. We made a Couple goals menu with everything truffled: the truffled veggie, the normal truffle, the truffled potatoes and the nutella cheesecake. It was all delicious! The only bad thing is that I did not find out when the order came out and they called me ...\n",
      "Until today I knew what Vice really was. I have passed by and the decoration and the music have caught my attention. I ordered a Pollos Hermanos, and OMG, it's hilarious!\n",
      "A new concept of restaurant and takeaway! We loved it. When we return to Barcelona we will surely return. Please don't stop trying their cheesecake\n",
      "It is not worth a 5, it is worth a 10 and with this I think there is no need to say more. The best Burger in the city (or if I dare say, in Spain) without a doubt. The marketing they do is brutal tmb.My vice of every week üòâ\n",
      "The restaurant is innovative from the start. The way to order is somewhat different: you scan a QR code, order and pay. After 5-10 minutes they call you and deliver your order, you can eat it at the place, which is tiny, or you can take it with you (it is ready to take it). The food is very good, we have tried the original vice and the bbq cheesburger bacon and everything is great, the potatoes are very good too and the dessert has been a very rich but a little cloying oreo tiramissu, for 2 people a dessert is fine. As a recommendation I would say that the bins should be larger since their hole is very small and normally you eat and throw the garbage in the bags (separating to recycle) and then throw everything together.As a detail, these days Aleix is ‚Äã‚Äãout there and is asking people how the food and attention are. All great, a 10.\n",
      "Very cool place, with a lot of personality. Good and fast service. The burger I ate, Vicio's, was good, though maybe a little expensive for what it was. The fries and desserts are very good.\n",
      "The burgers are spectacular as are the potatoes.As for the place, it is not a restaurant to eat with a group if you go with friends. It's more of a local delivery, and if you want to eat there, it has a mega table that you have to share with strangers. Another thing against is that you can only pay by card and orders have to be made on their website.\n",
      "The quantity and quality is very good, the desserts are tremendous.\n",
      "We were in Barcelona for 4 days and we ate VICIO twice. Little more to add.Excellent food in a rogue environment. Unbeatable !!!! Happy Anniversary\n",
      "How Great You Are Aleix. Thank you very much for your work and your team is the best. Thank you for making Life more tasty and happy !!! I recommend everyone to eat the Vice and enjoy it a lot! I will repeat your Burgers and Pizzas !!!! I like very much! Thank you\n",
      "Good pizzas and generous in quantity. The Neapolitan dough better than the Roman for my taste. Like but, one of the pizzas was a bit burnt. The marketing of the box is original and colorful, although of a peculiar vibe.Second order of burgers. They are very tasty\n",
      "We ordered take out and the brutal truffle egg burger.\n",
      "Very good burgers and potatoes, but for the price of the burger should come a serving of potatoes per person as needed. Because it sold a ration to share for two people and was very small, it corresponded to one ration, not two. Correct atmosphere and service.\n",
      "Delicious burgers. You can see the quality of the ingredients and the bread. We tried the originals vice and the bacon and very good. Perhaps the bacon stands out more for its intense flavor and to bring pieces of bacon with the burger.Crispy and hot potatoes despite arriving in delivery.The price is adjusted to the quality of the product you ask for, they are not expensive at all.We will repeat.\n",
      "In a previous review I have commented on the burgers, this time we ordered the pizza, acceptable.I would recommend trying the burgers.Earn points for the packaging, very good.\n",
      "Very good truffle burger, no potatoes ... They were cold, and made a long time ago\n",
      "All very good, but they go overboard with the salt. It is really excessive. If they could lower it considerably, I would put a 5 stars.\n",
      "When it comes to \"cheat meal day\" you have to try new options. The order has arrived properly packaged and on time, a little cold, I have ordered the Satisfyer plus May truffle combo. It has been ok.\n",
      "ONLY ONE GOOD BURGER HAS COME, FOR THE PRICE THAT IS APPEARABLE, WE EXPECTED ANOTHER TYPE OF SERVICE. THE POTATOES WERE VERY SALTY (may be a personal taste)\n",
      "We ordered burgers on the weekend and they were delicious. Without a doubt the best burgers in all of BCN !!!! At home we are all from VICIO! We will repeat for sure! I recommend it 200%\n",
      "Very good burgers, good treatment from employees and spectacular tiramisu! X true better to go without children, because they eat you dessert.\n",
      "Good product, but they must facilitate payment to customers, they only charge via the web\n",
      "Incredible burger place, good price and great fries and hamburger! Besides, the spectacular aftermath.\n",
      "I think the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant is take-out food, because eating there is an overwhelming feeling.Starting with the red light that within two minutes of being there you already want to leave, followed by a song so loud that it invites you to really leave the premises.We asked to clean the table and they came promptly to do so, but they threw all the crumbs on me.We have tried two burgers and there was nothing different or that makes you want to eat again. The potatoes smelled of old oil and went to the trash. The coke was hot (and they didn't have ice) but the beer was cold.To complete, when opening the oreo tiramisu there was a gift long hair :)An experience as remarkable as it is described on the website.\n",
      "Very good taste and quality burgers and potatoes, highly recommended.\n",
      "My life is not the same anymore. I just ordered for GLOVO and it was the best double cheeseburger of my life. That was an AMAZING burger. My life has changed. I still have hope in humanity and nouveau cuisine and burger. Thanks.\n",
      "CRAZY !!!! the best burger I've ever had. It is simple but brutal, it is not because of the hype. We ordered delivery and it arrived perfect, hot and very very very tasty. The hamburger was the cheese burger and the classic potatoes, delicious super crunchy. A thousand points, you can see that they put a lot of effort, the branding is cool!\n",
      "Behind an innovative image that gives high expectations does not disappoint. Spectacular burgers, clean and fast service. The truffle comes off. I give a 10 to the business concept, marketing and food\n",
      "I only asked Casa but UALAAAAA. I‚Äôm not much of a bourgeois either and these are wonderful. Not only do I congratulate the chefs, I also congratulate the marketing team who always manage to enchant me with their ads. And riders deserve a mention too. AWESOME SERVICE, EQUIPMENT and FOOD !! ALEIX is top!\n",
      "The food is very good, in relation to the price perhaps it is a bit expensive. I tried it when I asked for it at Glovo but since the opening of the new place I have not been able to eat there since it is small and you share a table. It is always full and cannot be reserved. It is a pity\n",
      "Good burgers and local mol√≥n. The music a bit loud, but overall good experience.\n",
      "The atmosphere is super nice, the music is great, the host at the door is charming, and the food ... wow! I cannot recommend it more. Those who have given them few stars have a stunted palate or something.\n",
      "The place has a good atmosphere and generally the service is good. Sadly, the burger is outrageously greasy and the bacon fries are lousy. It is more the hype that people have given it ... I do not recommend it\n",
      "All very good\n",
      "I highly recommend!The Burger are more than excellent, we ordered delivery and were very happy with the speed of delivery.The Burger are very high quality, the fries too, really happy to have trusted this restaurant.Go ahead with your eyes closed.\n",
      "Vice hamburger but cold potatoes and wings, it's a shame, because I would give it 5 stars. Keep working\n",
      "The hamburgers are very good, but there is no way they can pick up the phone to change an ingredient (remove sauce). In the end the order arrived with the sauce inside the hamburger, which we did not want.\n",
      "Burger flavor, spectacular. The truffled cheeseburger üñ§Very fast delivery.Normal that so many people like this Good Vice.The nutella cheesecake, good portion, nothing left hahahaDelicious.\n",
      "We placed an order through the Glovo app at 9:00 p.m., with the estimated delivery time of 35-45 minutes. An hour and a half later, they continue to delay the delivery time, the delivery man has been waiting for almost an hour to pick up our order, obviously we canceled the dinner, since there is no telephone number with which to contact the restaurant.\n",
      "I couldn't like it more, the Truffle is spectacular and the potatoes, perfect to accompany it. Very good work, congratulations!\n",
      "You were asking me how is it? Self-service ... price above the attention, you had neither ice nor lemon for a Coca-Cola, there is no attention beyond a delivery window and there are 40 e for two people ... hamburgers ... correct but overrated\n",
      "The place is super Instagrammable, the boys were a love and the burgers were at another level: it does what it promises! The only thing that makes me angry is not living in Barcelona to fall into real vice!\n",
      "It must be delicious because it is always up to the mark. For my taste a little music scandal for dinner and having a somewhat difficult conversation\n",
      "Beautiful but expensive.\n",
      "I placed an order at Glovo that had to go straight to the trash. Inedible because of how salty it was. The potatoes were coated in salt.\n",
      "Hamburger is very good but gave 3 because the fries were bad: burnt and old.As you see in the photo.\n",
      "Best burquers I have tried without a doubt.The truffle leaves its marküî•\n",
      "I bought using glovo. Combo satisfayer and vegan truffle burger. Nothing to write home about when it comes to flavor. I will not ask again.\n",
      "This hamburger restaurant, more oriented to home delivery or collection, has not seemed anything special to me. The place is not designed to be able to eat there and it is not very cozy, although there is a large central table where you can eat, but the chairs are somewhat uncomfortable.The ordering system is not entirely practical and is done from the mobile.The burgers are nothing special, the meat is rather dry and without much flavor. I ordered a BBQ and the barbecue was conspicuous by its absence. As for the potatoes, there is not much praise to be made either, somewhat dry, almost stiff.Those who say they are one of the best burgers in Barcelona really show that they don't know many burger shops in the city ...All this seasoned with certainly high prices for the quality and product they offer. Maybe I had a bad day in the kitchen, but first impressions are very important.From the staff, nothing to complain about, friendly and attentive.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant to order great burgers! Not only that, but the desserts and pizzas are spectacular !! If you want vice, this is your place. If you want to eat really well, this is your place. If you want a much more than personalized treatment, this is your place. Don't hesitate to order your food at home !!\n",
      "Best burger in Barcelona !! Love the vice originals üí´\n",
      "Always a hit, truffle cheeseburger and BBQ my favorites. Even the impressive potatoes.\n",
      "Very good burgers.The fatal wings.The potatoes with parmesan and truffle goodDesserts are worth nothing.In addition, you cannot pay with cash and you have to ask for it through the application, a roll. There is only one large, communal table with stools to sit on. All very uncomfortable.3 burgers2 wings1 potato2 waters2 soft drinks2 dessertsTotal: 53 euros\n",
      "The hamburgers were very good, the breadMax (no sesame. Thanks god!) Truffled potatoes from another world. Being a new place, the process is adjusting little by little. So patience and good chat with friends while you wait.100% quality üôåüèΩüôåüèΩü§òüèΩ\n",
      "Perhaps because it was just starting, it has not been the best experience. The QR issue is a bit of a mess and there was no willingness to help. If not for another client I would not have found out. The burgers good without going overboard. The potatoes a bit soggy. The waiting time in my case was excessive due to the amount of deliveries they receive. You cannot pay in cash. All with a bank card. Hopefully they improve as constructive criticism because I will not repeat in particular...\n",
      "Excellent service and stone oven pizzas. Recommendable.\n",
      "The burger is super good (BBQ chesseburguer), to say one downside is that it took literally 2 minutes to deliver 2 burgers with potatoes and dessert and they were somewhat cold just like the potatoes. It didn't seem freshly made and it's a shame because the flavor was so rich. Another thing that could perhaps be improved was the volume of the music and the type (techno) that I suppose who likes it great but who wants to dine quietly perhaps was excessive. It was like having dinner at the entrance of Pacha Ibiza, although I suppose the workers were motivated by listening to music üòÜ. It will surely give you a second chance.\n",
      "Slow (they give priority to Glovo orders) to order aCombo 30 min wait and then they get the wrong dessert. My burger was soggy overcooked dry my boyfriend was fine he liked it for this I put a star.\n",
      "I have to say that it is probably one of the best hamburgers we have ever tasted, I was afraid that they will arrive cold, but they have arrived more than perfect, in a more than striking bag ... I loved it, we have ordered the combo for two, We have ordered the truffle burgers that are from another world, it is a perfect combination, the super tasty potatoes and the amazing Oreo tiramisu. The packaging is spectacular from start to finish, an experience that we will repeat for sure! Congratulations on the work to the whole team!\n",
      "So far I had only tried a few hamburgers that had left me speechless and they were the \"Goiko\" but the truth is that Vicio's hamburgers are another level, the first time in Barcelona and we could not leave without trying them. Congratulations to Aleix and the entire team because they are going to give a lot to talk about!\n",
      "Please I have given you a good review, let me ask\n",
      "I would give it five stars, for attention, quality, presentation, but I went with my grandson to look for a hamburger for dinner and when we got home, disappointed, they gave us truffle instead of bacon, so I had to prepare a homemade one for him. little üòî\n",
      "Outstanding price-quality ratio. Cheeseburger as a first choice, to die for! Upgradeable potato chips\n",
      "Scandalous. Without a doubt the best burger I have ever eaten in my life. My girlfriend and I have ordered the 'couple goals' combo with two truffle burgers. When we have taken the first bite and the egg has exploded in our mouth we have hallucinated. Special mention for the nutella cheesecake, creamy and absolutely delicious. Fully recommended site if you pass through Barcelona.\n",
      "Incredibly good, it deserves the price you pay. The truffle is irresistible\n",
      "One of the best chicken burgers I've ever had. Very good packaging and very fast delivery, the hamburgers have arrived hot and the potatoes very crispy, to put a mistake, of the 6 wings, 1 raw wine\n",
      "The most horrible thing to eat\n",
      "Punctual and fabulous burgers that make the truth a real vice üòåü§§Thanks for the good treatmentüíñ\n",
      "Amazing burgers. But it is not a very good place to stay to eat there.\n",
      "We placed an order through a digital platform and after a while, Vice called us to inform us that the delivery man had picked up the order but that it had been lost. On the part of Vicio, they very sincerely apologized (taking into account that it was not their fault), they prepared the habmurgers for us again and made an agreement with the platform themselves to send another delivery man. Of course, it planted!ps: they sent us a delicious dessert that we hadn't ordered.Thank you very much Vice !! and all delicious as always;)\n",
      "A place that will surely close soon. They do not accept cash as a means of payment, they do not explain or guide how to order and the prices are not at all competent!\n",
      "Overrated. Much hype for so little chicha.\n",
      "A scandal!We have ordered bbq and truffle. The meat, the bread, the potatoes and the dessert: everything has a distinctive touch. From 10! And also, fast service and as we have collected it there, very good service. We will repeat and recommend it! Bravo ... Congratulations!\n",
      "All amazing. The burgers, the packaging, everything. We will repeat 100% for sure.\n",
      "Even the eggs of loud music all day, until almost midnight and the noise they make. Very bad coexistence, wishing they would leave\n",
      "Very rich burgersü§§\n",
      "The best burger I have eaten in Barcelona. Iberian, Truffled and Cheeseburger are spectacular and my favorites. Tasty fries and desserts (tiramisu and oreo) are VICIOUS.\n",
      "The burgers are incredible but the music so loud is unbearable\n",
      "I ordered Vice, the service was fast, the packaging tremendous, the beastly marketing and the food ... Vice.The fresh vegetables, the greasy meat, the soft bread, the tasty cheese and everything together ... Like hearing Overkill from Motorhead for the first time.It's been a long time since I spent all my nights thinking about the same thing ...Since I asked, I only think about vice, at all times and in all ways.Soon another score with more vice.\n",
      "For me, the best burgers right now in Barcelona! They are tremendous !!! But what makes them even better is the service behind them, always attentive and detailed. The two times we have asked we had problems with the delivery people and in both cases they worried about calling us and fixing it, although it had not been their fault directly. Thanks and congratulations to Aleix, Carlos and the entire team for your spectacular work!\n",
      "Very good packaging, super original, but personally I expected a better taste, a bit bland.\n",
      "Very well coordinated.\n",

      "Very rich burgers at a price a little higher than usual, even so it is worth going to try them, as a tip they come with a lot of potatoes that can be shared perfectly with two!\n",
      "The best burguers in the city!\n",
      "We asked for a glovo as the founder saw that Masterchef won. We ordered 4 different ones to try them all: the vegan one, the chicken one and two with beef. I was pleasantly surprised by the chicken and the vegan ones, but I have to say that as for the veal ones, I have eaten many better ones in other places. The desserts (we ordered two the oreo tiramisu and the nutella cheesecake) are delicious\n",
      "Spectacular burgers and pizzas.\n",
      "I love them, I have tried several empty ones and the truth is that they have put effort into all the packaging so that everything arrives in order and very well, I hope to soon be able to go to eat at the Restaurant and fill myself more with vice. the wings are to die for.\n",
      "We have ordered a bbq and a vice, the hamburgers very good, the order has arrived a little cold and the bread a little oily. Otherwise, it has a lot of flavor.The dessert without a spoon.But recommended!\n",
      "Brutal! The best burgers (and chicken wings) I've ever eaten üòç\n",
      "I have never been given so much pleasure with a meal ...Alexis if you see this review that you know that I leave you, definitely vice if it gives me mine ...\n",
      "Good accommodation, but they treated me 1h30 to serve the order + the delivery time. At peak times they are not enough. I hope they can improve it in the future and that customers can have compensation for it now, that if I left a physical restaurant I would have already left\n",
      "ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ I will be back !! I don t like it, i love it üòç good luck\n",
      "The service was excellent. On the weekend there is a lot of demand but the wait is worth it. We will repeat\n",
      "We ordered burgers, fries, and dessert. By far the best we've had in a long time! The point of the meat is perfect (we chose the vice and the bacon cheeseburger) the crispy and tasty potatoes (they have nothing to do with those offered by other burgers) and the oreo tiramisu is delicious.You can see that behind there is an incredible design work, the packaging materials denote quality and networking is another level! In short, you can see that the work is very well done and that is why although it may seem a bit expensive, if we take into account everything that is behind it, it is a more than fair price! It certainly deserves the fame it has!\n",
      "Just seeing it takes away the desire to eat, not to mention the price of ‚Ç¨ 14 and no differences or the meat.\n",
      "The burger was delicious! I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Through a delivery app, it is the second time I have ordered hamburgers at this establishment and it will not be the last ... since they are ... VICIOUS !!!Congratulations to your team and continue like this üí™\n",
      "The service and packaging is very good. However, I have ordered the truffle burger following recommendations from friends and I have hardly noticed the \"truffle\" flavor. Also, I would recommend putting an option from the point of meat, mine was well cooked. Much to envy of other burger restaurants in Barcelona\n",
      "Excellent service and the best burgers I have ever eaten !!! Not to mention the potatoes ü§§ We will repeat without a doubtüëåüèº\n",
      "The meat of the spectacular hamburger, the bread the same, to put a but the soft and oily potatoes, although you could tell that they were homemade, so I could not and will not ask again, the bacon made pure and charred, nor did it add any taste And the mouthfeel was unpleasant, it's worth it anyway.\n",
      "bad experience, hamburgers and fast food at a gold price!\n",
      "the packaging is fantastic. The service too. But the burgers better\n",
      "Spectacular burger. I will definitely repeat\n",
      "TREMEEENSS! We repeat that I would say el Ga√∫cho!\n",
      "We love Vice! Brutal burgers, tastys, freshyyyyyyyy!\n",
      "One of the best burgers we have ever tasted! Oh, and the fries are amazing!\n",
      "All great, I recommend it without a doubt üòç\n",
      "When you want to realize there is no hamburger left, only remains of the sauce from the mouth. A bit like when they don't remember to warn you;)\n",
      "A fantastic experience. It is sure that I repeat. The tasting menu is really top notch. It is a haute cuisine school. Although it is the students who serve you, they convey an incredible attitude and exquisite professionalism. Their teachers supervise them at a distance and you feel very well cared for at all times. They complement the menu with a varied pairing at all times. You feel like you are in the kitchen of famous chefs. The price-quality ratio is outstanding and they do not allow tips. Highly recommended üëèüëèüëèüëè\n",
      "A restaurant with a lot of treats and a great lunch and a great presentation\n",
      "We ate very well and they served us great !!!!\n",
      "The table service very well. The food quite regular ... the cuscus totally tasteless. I went hungry and I didn't finish it. Pasta and dessert also very basic. The head of the room asked me how was it, and when she saw that I didn't like it, she turned and left me with the word in her mouth. I do not put a star because the waiters were very friendly.The hotel school of Pueblo Nuevo makes millions of turns in every way.\n",
      "Very good value for money, with a very good table and a lot of attention to the aesthetics and presentation of the dishes. Very attentive service. In our case, they took dessert too long, and they didn't let us tip - they deserved it!\n",
      "We arrived for lunch at noon. The girl attends us very kindly and is going to ask who would be in charge of a table. He returns to the moment saying that it is a bit fair, that they give a table until 3:30 p.m. I look at the clock and it was 15:15! ? ... And this is a hospitality school ??? Well, they will not come out very well prepared in customer service.\n",
      "A good place to have a tasting menu, served by third and second year CETT students. Ours was Christmas, with a price of ‚Ç¨ 35. There were starters (tapioca crisp + prawn tartare + apple yarrow), eggplant wrap, fish (smoked dock), meat (low temperature lamb) and dessert (chocolate mousse + small fours). All this paired with cava (Estelada Ros√©), white wine (Vi√±a Esmeralda), red wine (Atrium Merlot), sweet wine (Floral Muscat), water, coffee and an infusion.\n",
      "A delightful experience. Exquisite food and exceptional service. They are very well prepared young people who make you feel as if you are in a Michelin star. I recommend the tasting menu.\n",
      "They have 2 tasting menus I recommend MENU D'AVANTGUARDA it is very good choice very well-arranged dishes highlight the Ceviche de Llagostins Calamr√ßet amb Trometas de la Mort and Melos de Vedella at low temperature with nuts and chestnuts, desserts and wine pairing and fabulous cava Service exquisite very well supervised perceive the sensation of a typical \"star\" restaurant in a center accredited as CETTI was previously a few years ago but I noticed changes in the design of the room and facilities but the quality and service certainly did not change I encourage you to continue in this line\n",
      "It eats well, but the place is not cozy.\n",
      "What I like the most about this place is the spacious and wonderful terrace. Correct attention. Food quality good, but can be improved. Anyway, I would go back.\n",
      "The first time I have been to this place, I loved it, a stately place with modern touches, large rooms for groups, a wonderful terrace where you can enjoy the good weather of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa varied and well-prepared menu\n",
      "The spectacular food, the comfortable atmosphere. In the interior patio we have been luxurious, very comfortable chairs and table with tablecloth.The price is very good and more in the nights of June, during the week, a perfect menu.We will repeat very soon.\n",
      "We celebrate 25 years of nursing, the treatment with the excellent waiters and very good food, highlighting the professionalism and good treatment of Rosa\n",
      "A restaurant located on the first floor, the lunchtime menu on weekdays of ‚Ç¨ 17 something, with coffee and drinks, a varied menu, very well presented, with enough quantity, the service more than fantastic, the facilities very careful, very pleasant decoration , tables well set, respecting the distances between tables of leftovers. In short, a very pleasant place to return.\n",
      "I discovered it with a friend and we went in for dinner. The restaurant was half full, so they put us on the terrace but it was still very good. The food was delicious and the staff very attentive and helpful. The price was the best of all, very good to be in the center of Barcelona. We will repeat for sure! :)\n",
      "I didn't like it. I ordered the menu and it didn‚Äôt convince me at all. I will not go back.\n",
      "Restaurant located on the first floor of a building on the Paseo de Gracia. We ate a weeknight menu at ‚Ç¨ 18. The quality was pretty good. We ate very comfortably and were well cared for. The restaurant is very nice and spacious, it also has an interior terrace.\n",
      "We went for my mother's birthday and we loved both the decor and the atmosphere as well as the food. Also the waiters were very friendly. I recommend it.\n",
      "We used to go a few times when we went shopping in Barcelona and today we decided to go again‚Ä¶ The restaurant is fine and the food is good but today is going to be the last day we go. My mother has the habit of asking for butter to accompany bread in all restaurants, so today was not going to be an exception. The surprise has been when we have seen that they have charged us ‚Ç¨ 3 for the butter from the supermarket ... Really the annoyance does not come because of the price, but because they had never charged us and today it is. I suppose they have seen us with the face of tourists (which is not the case) and have wanted to take advantage of us ... For the simple fact of this gesture, we will not return again.\n",
      "A restaurant in the heart of Barcelona where it is perfect for both celebrations and informal lunch / dinner. Excellent value for money and very good treatment. I certainly repeat every time I can!\n",
      "The restaurant is kind and renovated to a house that lived well over a hundred years ago. The atmosphere is also good. I think it's three stars\n",
      "Very good food. Cabrales croquettes, cod fritters, Beef sirloin with Cabrales cream and apple !!!! ALL GOOD. THE Waitress who served us very KIND AND ATTENTIVE !!!!. Something very curious that we tried ..... SANGRIA DE CIDRA ... VERY ADVISABLE !!!\n",
      "I love it, good cuisine and excellent atmosphere.\n",
      "Good place, with a pretty large outdoor space. The food is pretty good! Happy!\n",
      "Nice place and good lunch. Adequate prices.\n",
      "Finally I enjoy a good menu at a reasonable price and in a privileged place ...\n",
      "An ideal place to go alone, as a couple, family or friends. Exquisite attention and good product ...\n",
      "Fantastic we were on the terrace q is very spacious and the food very good\n",
      "Nice terrace.Very correct human treatment.Fair dishes in quantity\n",
      "Complete facilities, both interior and exterior, fresh terrace, spacious and very quiet, totally to eat with the family.-Pleasant service and with a lot of customization and customer service, you feel like you are at home.‚Ç¨ 28 closed menu, with 4, 5 starters and a second course fish or meat - normal quality of food (nothing special), highlighting that it is a medium categorical restaurant. They are not rats like other places!I give it 3 stars for the food, in the end I go to a restaurant for the food even though the service and the place are 100 quality.Recommended? Yes\n",
      "Good reception and good value for money\n",
      "Very good attention received and the food very good and well presented\n",
      "Great place. Family reunions with friends a 10\n",
      "We booked for a birthday and we were well looked after. The food was delicious.\n",
      "Very good food in this restaurant that is worth knowing, to find it, but especially to taste its dishes.A good choice of wines available, and easily associated with dishes √† la carte.The service is efficient and very friendly. A lot of surface, a single bathroom, you have to be sure that there will not be too many people, otherwise you will queue to wash your hands.\n",
      "A charming place, I have already repeated several times and always wanting to return. Very good price quality and very attentive and pleasant service.Highly recommended.\n",
      "Of those restaurants that you attended at family celebrations at another time and that you continue to go to for dinner with your partner or with a group.The kitchen is well prepared and the atmosphere is very relaxed.It is curious to access through a staircase of neighbors.\n",
      "The interior patio is beautiful and it is super quietThe food is very goodPizzas are not his thing\n",
      "Very good value for money, good service. Nice atmosphere, recommended for celebrations\n",
      "Experience in a group of classmates. They have very attractive reservations, as well as the decoration of the whole restaurant. Closed evening menu of 25 eur quite correct with several options to choose from and in the middle of Passeig de Gracia. Very attentive and helpful service. A Filipino girl who made the effort to speak to us in Catalan at all times; thanks. The food was well served and coordinated. Correct quality and quantity. To be taken into account and especially in any celebration or group meeting. The best reserved is the roundabout.\n",
      "Pretty good.I recommend the foie gras chocolates\n",
      "The restaurant is very welcoming and the menu is rich and varied. Although it was festive, I found the menu expensive. There was a bit of a delay in serving us, perhaps because there were a lot of customers. But I'll give it another chance.\n",
      "Well presented dishes. Good quality / price\n",
      "We were a group of friends and we were surprised, spacious rooms, attentive staff and very good food ... highly recommended. Commensurate value for money ... We will surely repeat\n",
      "Very good value for money and the place is very nice\n",
      "Good menu price quality in a very central location and very good service\n",
      "Nice restaurant in paseo de gracia. They also hold events. The only thing that I found a little regular were the squids that were very hard and the Iberico ham that had little. Deal correct.\n",
      "Restaurant that I highly recommend. Very well placed with a discreet then atypical entrance, direction the 1st floor by the staircase or the elevator. A wooden door and you're there. The restaurant offers √† la carte dishes but above all a menu at 23 ‚Ç¨ with champagne and amuse bouche (now fatty), choice of choice (3), choice of dish (3), choice of dessert (3), a bottle of water, a glass of wine and coffee. The dishes are generous and very good (a little too salty for my taste for the main dish). To spend a pleasant time on the terrace or indoors, don't hesitate.\n",
      "For the place where it is, it resists to become a tourist attraction. Reasonable prices and quite good quality. The interior is huge and has many rooms. Great interior terrace that you do not expect.\n",
      "It is a neighborhood menu bar, a polygon ... it is not worth calling itself a restaurant, much less being on Paseo de Gr√†cia, since it detracts from it in its attempt to take advantage of the location. It is noticeable that the company skimps on all kinds of qualities, not only the product it serves but also the personnel with low (if not null) professional qualification, with whom it is difficult to understand in Spanish (I am not saying in Catalan!). Not suitable for foodies, gourmets ... not even for minimally demanding palates.\n",

The starters with foie gras and salmon have left me speechless ... Very good deal !!!We will be back soon!\n",
      "I have made a reservation and the manager has been very professional and attentive.A delight in these times.\n",
      "3.5 ‚≠êÔ∏èOverall, everything is fine.Expensive prices, but fairly large portions.The bread, DELICIOUS. Very good. The gold cap a 10.We fell in love with the \"Lizard\", very very good, although there were only four cuts of meat (19 ‚Ç¨). With a very good sauce.The ribs very well.The \"Lechazo\" well, but left us indifferent, and was worth 46 ‚Ç¨. Baked potatoes okay, but the chips we thought were frozen.For dessert, the cheesecake left a lot to be desired. We would not recommend it.But I lowered the score for several reasons.At first, we were frustrated because they have few dishes, but of the few, many did not. They had nothing in the stone. Of the four desserts, they also only had two. We understand that the situation is difficult, but that a place of meat does not have any of the dishes on the stone, at 1.30 noon ...Secondly, the QR letter only came out in Spanish. Our waiter also only spoke Spanish. We would like to be able to be attended to in Catalan.\n",
      "Excellent service, unbeatable food, great, great professionals\n",
      "Terrible! Awfully DELICIOUS restaurant! The menu is not big, but you don't need more. Excellent Dairy Pork and very Young Lamb! The Lamb is just 15 out of 10 and the Piglet is simply Delightful. We do not recommend going 1 time - you need to take this place for regular visits with your Family and friends.\n",
      "Good meat, and good service!\n",
      "I had been wanting to eat at this steakhouse for a long time after having gone to other similar ones in Barcelona. The truth is that the quality of the lamb is very good and the place is beautiful and spacious to respect the distance between diners due to the Covid issue. I did not like that after booking three weeks ago nobody will tell us that in San Esteban it was a closed menu and you could not order by letter (luckily my partner and I like practically everything, otherwise it would have been a problem). Christmas is quite complete, although second only is lamb, the soup of the starter I noticed a bit bland. I also did not like that the bottle of wine from the closed menu was already open (all the tables were the same). I consider that with a menu of 55 euros the place setting is to be appreciated for a lower quality wine but unopened ... The treatment of the staff and atmosphere of the cozy place, the donuts and the after-dinner liquor a detail.\n",
      "Great food. The staff is very attentive and kind\n",
      "Muy bueno todo, very delicious dinner. The lamb and beef are very good. The roast potatoes and bread are perfect. The interior decoration is classic. The exterior view is not as good as Tibidabo, but the parking is very convenient. I recommend everyone to come, and many locals come here. Home. I prefer lamb chops to lamb shanks, as well as after-dinner wine and snacks.\n",
      "Fantastic restaurant to enjoy a lunch or dinner, quiet space and good service. I recommend ordering the ribeye, it is one of the best I have ever eaten. For me 5 stars.\n",
      "Really very good. to eat calmly\n",
      "A CURIOUS THING IS THAT YOU GO THREE AS ‚Äã‚ÄãSIX, THE AMOUNT IS THE SAME!QUALITY IS SUPREME !.\n",
      "The meat restaurant. The meat plus or minus is good, almost all is slightly fat) the lamb is good. the place is not the most iconic, the wine list is simple. The same place at the foot of Tibidabo is much better\n",
      "A classic, but safe, good quality food and friendly staff\n",
      "Good gastronomy Although the service does not accompany the same level. The place is very typical of the group. Worth. Although the price is not economical.\n",
      "We have frequented it for many years and the changes are getting better.Our favorite dish the t-bone steak although all the dishes on the menu are fantastic.I recommend 100%\n",
      "It is a shop of Castilian Food in northern Spain. All dishes are delicious, but especially grilled Iberian pork is delicious. At around 20 euros per person, I enjoyed the appetizers, salads and grills, and I was very hungry.\n",
      "I love it! One of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa very good menu with delicious food, the suckling lamb and ribs cannot be missed. Good wine list and first class service, I always return. I recommend 100%\n",
      "Excellent product, good starters and best main dishes, amazing suckling always accompanied by great wines!\n",
      "Aranda's roast lamb does not fail !!A classic, very advisable if you like meat and good food. The very attentive service,First we got a pica-pica with sausage, black pudding, hash and roasted peppers with citrus touches, accompanied by a glass of cava.Second one of the star dishes: the LechazoFinally, for dessert, a puff pastry filled with custard and cream, very rich.How could it be otherwise a spectacular Ribera del Duero red wine to accompany the excellent meat.\n",

      "Good product, good qualityA bit of service is missing\n",
      "Super good suckling lamb. Butifarra (black pudding with rice) superb. Oven and barbecue inside the restaurant. Very characteristic environment. Very professional and kind staff. High prices but commensuated with quality and service.\n",
      "Grilled kidneys like the old ones ... and a lamb to lick your fingers.\n",
      "Good quality Castilian food. Everything they prepare is very good, from the cheese or ham boards, the fried eggs, or the lamb. Whenever we can, we will eat. Yesterday we ate suckling pig and we really liked it. I will definitely be back for the food and the staff, who are very friendly and attentive.\n",
      "Com.always excellent. treatment and food. You know what food you will find and it is delicious. It's well worth it.\n",

      "Good place to eat with the family on Mother's Day. Varied and quality menu. Optimal amount to reach the donuts with pomace. Excellent table service treatment with Patricia.\n",
      "If you like meat, it's a good place. The Fiorentina served raw in small pieces to be cooked on the soapstone is a really interesting way, the lamb is particular and tasty.\n",
      "Nice restaurant, very good service! Charlie one of the waiters served us in luxury and surprised us with a great dessert! Quality food and good wine list, we will repeat!\n",
      "A very good place to eat meat, the price is a bit expensive but I understand that you have high costs for where you are located and due to the high quality of the raw material. The entrecote has seemed too small to me, used to eating entrecote in farmhouses in towns on the outskirts of Barcelona. The blood sausage and other dishes make a spectacular cuisine. One of Castilian origin around here who knows these dishes well ... if you sold at home it would be great. I don't know if you do it now, but if not, it is a good option.\n",
      "A spectacular suckling pig! We will repeat for sure!\n",
      "I will be very brief, after going repeatedly to this establishment, today we have returned with a client.We arrive at 2:00 p.m., and when we ask the waiter, he tells us that there are no Lamb chops, that they have run out ... It seems a bit strange to us since they have opened at 1:00 p.m., but go all over it's understandable.What is not understood is that the invoice amounts to ‚Ç¨ 165 and when we want to make the payment with a ‚Ç¨ 200 bill they tell us that it cannot be, that the bank does not accept it .....That we pay you with a different ticket. This is hilarious.\n",
      "Good treatment, emblematic cuisine, highly recommended\n",
      "The ham of excellent quality, the cut not so much\n",
      "Perfect, you eat very well üëç\n",
      "Very cozy restaurant to go as a couple or to be well with anyone. The food was exceptional, we chose the steak on the stone and they ask you the type of cut you want, a great success. The stone is changed without having to ask. At the end of the meal, they offer you some pastas and shots that come in handy.\n",
      "Excellent service and quality.\n",
      "I love to eat piglet in this place. Although the digestion will take my toll. It is not perfect as I have eaten in Segovia but it is coming.\n",

      "Small restaurant (approx. 35pax) with a very positive trajectory close to the S. Family. The place is l, original of its 45 years but very well preserved, they have inside d, another room with respect to the main dining room and entrance bar.Its Catalan / Basque cuisine is aromatic, forceful, and worked with local products. Stews of meat, fish (especially cod) pasta, soups, starters, mushrooms, etc. All dishes are well finished and presented.The room and kitchen service is attentive and close to dealing with customers. Nearby is pk. of payment, since on the street is all green area.It is really worth visiting it to enjoy all the organoleptic nuances that your paid dishes produce at a reasonable price.They also have a very good wine and cavas menu.\n",
      "A classic restaurant in Barcelona where they continue to cook very well. I highlight the cannelloni from the yaya, the m√∫rgulas, the ravioli ... In our case we have shared the first ones and thus we have been able to enjoy all of them.And all in a very familiar environment.\n",

      "Very good restaurant! We stumbled upon it by chance. Well a great surprise!Marvellous !\n",
      "The food is very good and the service right. Typical cuisine of a lifetime with good product. The place is old and the services poorly maintained. To my taste, they abuse the oil with almost every dish and the exorbitant prices for the dishes they offer.\n",

      "Good place, quiet, the best fricando ...\n",
      "With the utmost respect to the entire restaurant team, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE restaurant ABSOLUTELY. Outdated, with unprofessional service and poor quality of the genre offered; with a little varied menu and exorbitant prices. Furthermore, hygiene has left a lot to be desired. I WOULD NOT REPEAT IN THIS PLACE.\n",
      "Spectacular, very familiar place with a private dining room for about 12 people. My favorite dishes, the potato with caviar, murgulas with foie, croquettes (ham, mushrooms ...) the clams, Iberian secret and the wagyu meat that is served in the pan.

      "One of the gastronomic pearls of the Ensanche has lost a star. It is still a highly recommended place, but its menu has been reduced and the value for money has suffered. Still, it's worth it. Don't miss his Dray Martini by Manuel Silva.\n",

I love eating at this restaurant.12-23-18As always an excellent treatment and exquisite food.Perhaps young people or more modern people do not like the place as they indicate in some other comments that I have seen in a review.But for me it is one of the very few charming restaurants that remain in Barcelona.Restaurant with its own history üëçüëç\n",

Total disappointment, a gray, expensive meal, and the waiters determined that we consume more wine.It does not have anywhere near the quality, the treatment, and the menu that I remember. I do not know how many people I recommended this restaurant, now with regret, I would not recommend it to any friend.\n",

It‚Äôs a source of pride to be a customer of a restaurant that has been demonstrating for so many years what it‚Äôs like to have a trade. I recommend the Nebraska steak or the Morels.

You must go at least once! surely repeat Daily menu with many first and second to choose for ‚Ç¨ 20\n",
      "I have ordered ravioli from the yaya for the first course, they have brought cannelloni that, feeling it very much, does not seem homemade. Second course cod with Alioli, the aioli would be one of those sold in the supermarket, it does not have the flavor of the usual aioli, the one prepared by the yaya. Very good for tourists who do not know the taste of home cooking. He has lost a lot. Greetings.\n",
      "Iaia weekend menu, 19.5. Generous ration, homemade and rich food. We ordered fish soup, cannelloni (very good) and pate ravioli (somewhat salty). In seconds, cod with spinach cream (spectacular), fricand√≥ de vedella (very good), lamb ribs and flamingos. Desserts were good too, highlighting the chocolate coulant.As the only bad point, the dishes were staggered at the wrong time, so it was 10 minutes between the first and last.We will repeat without a doubt, rich, at a good price and 5 minutes walking from the Sagrada Familia.\n",

      "I ate the menu, 19.5 euros, and the bread and drink added to 23 euros, recommended fish soup and squid, as well as local beer. CP value is flat, expensive, but the clerk is kind, things are still fairly\n",
      "All the food is excellent. The treatment by the employees is magnificent. 100% recommendable\n",
      "Very friendly, we were short on time and they did their best to be able to serve quickly. The grilled vegetables very well and the goat roll salad too. The ribeye .... very good, according to the rest of the food. For dessert, freshly prepared Catalan cream, very good too. Totally recommendable.\n",
      "Special lunchtime menu great to invite your partner and clients or suppliers. It was a bit hot by the way in the indoor dining room today 10/20/2021. He fixed himself by taking desserts and coffees on the outside terrace.\n",
      "Special place with special food, we got along really well with sophisticated dishes and never dull, very affordable prices special evening.\n",
      "A cozy place, with a spectacular menu of the day in value for money. Also with options of all kinds for celiacs, including bread. The treatment received also stood out for its attention and affection. We reserve the last star until we try the tasting menu. See you soon!\n",
      "The best restaurant in BCN I've been to so far.In addition to excellent cuisine and treatment, the recommendations were very good for us to choose the wine or the tumaca bread as a starter / side.There is no but.The atmosphere, also 10(Photos are missing of a \"green\" gazpacho that they gave us to try as well as the potatoes that accompanied the ribeye)\n",
      "Nice place, good dishes and attentive staff. They have a highly recommended ribeye menu. Good value for money.\n",
      "Incredible. The couple have gone out to 64 euros with 5 drinks. One entrecote per person etc. I recommend the menu is very good.The kitchen of 10 and the room service as well. A great find. We will be back.\n",
      "Brutal! We love coming with the family to this restaurant because it is ‚Äúgood, nice and cheap‚Äù. In addition, it has a very complete and well-priced lunch menu. My recommendations are: the coca bread, the cheese tasting, the starry eggs with foie gras and Serrano ham and the beef entrecote (with the stone plate).\n",
      "A very cozy restaurant, they have treated us great and the food is very good !!!\n",
      "I recommend !Very good, homemade, a mixture of flavors, pretty plates, adorable waiters with little attentions. We were taken by the weather but we will come back to taste the desserts!In the photo, these are homemade croquettes, 3 different tastes, very nice for once you don't have to choose the taste!\n",
      "The meat is very good together with spectacular grilled artichokes !! the only downside is that when I went, I didn't even know that the extractor in the kitchen didn't work very well but the smoke reached upstairs, where I was sitting with my friends. I hope it is something specific because it is very good, I recommend it.\n",
      "I receive advertising, through a media outlet, from this site, which I do not know. It is advertised as Vic Braseria and with many Catalan specialties. But, curiously, neither the advertisement nor any of his letters are in this language, which I consider a remarkable lack of consideration.\n",
      "Rectifying is wise. A few months ago I put a star on you and I was disappointed in the service. Today all are praises for this restaurant. The quality of the product is spectacular, delicious and powerful. The friendliness of the wonderful waiter. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "Varied menu with fresh and seasonal products.\n",
      "The grilled meat was impressive. Very attentive staff to change the stone for another to which they begin to cool. In general, very good treatment. The place is very cozy and the temperature inside is ideal\n",
      "We tried the menu of the day, very good, reasonable price and the attention of the staff was excellent, thank you\n",
      "I can only recommend it !!!!A real pleasure. We have been coming to Barcelona for 6 years and enjoy the evening there in a cozy atmosphere. Excellent Catalan cuisine, super friendly service and a pleasant atmosphere to end the day.Interesting details can be found on her Instagram page.6 out of 5 stars would be deserved !!\n",
      "Great food.Menu with a lot of variety to choose from.Excellent, fast and attentive service.I will repeat experience and I will tell you.Place with details and charm.Today I found a calm and familiar environment. When people left, they wished you good luck: they were happy !!!\n",
      "The dishes very well prepared and correct quality. Everything is very good, although the table wine fails a bit.\n",
      "Very good meat !!!\n",
      "Cozy. Attentive and friendly staff. And of course, spectacular variety of meats and very well cooked to the point you want. One more point in favor are the small snacks that the house invites. Highly recommended.\n",
      "100% recommended site. Good food, good presence and cordial and kind treatment of the workers. What more could you want. If you are a carnivore, this is your place. The fantasy dessert of ice cream, meringue and hot chocolate highly recommended.\n",
      "I recommend visiting this restaurant. Ideal for dining with your family or your couple. Delicious grilled vegetables and meat.\n",
      "How you notice that the people of Osona have good bait !! 9 months of winter and 3 of hell !!\n",
      "Bad service and really bad steaks with scary prices! Now that owners do not know their own food tarlik, I choose to add more pictures of his bad steak containing 200 grams of bone and 200 grams of fat and with a price of 50 ‚Ç¨ per kilo you can count on what you pay. Not to mention that he opens bottles of beer at the bar and divides it into glasses before serving, two small cans of beer he divides into three glasses that he charges for. Do not forget that he also pays for his poor service, and it is not in the menu. Good and ashamed of everything.\n",
      "Negative experience. We did not get to taste the food. We had a terrace reservation. We arrived and tables were occupied. After 25 minutes of waiting a waitress tells us to take a table for us. After another 10 minutes, another waiter comes out and tells us that the kitchen closes at 4:00 p.m. The thing about taking table nothing. Who will bring the bill to the group and wait for the table to clear. The group had not appeared for almost 15 minutes, having finished eating. If they had worried they would have probably already left. It is bad to write negative things at this time, but they should serve to improve. We went to eat somewhere else.\n",
      "Simply 2 words Excellent and Excellent, extraordinary treatment of the waitress and exquisite food, quality price a 10, we will return to taste more dishes.\n",
      "I went there because it was a local restaurantBasically friendly and lots of localsThe sausages are cheeseless and the menu is really good\n",
      "Top. Excellent meat. John. A very special Neapolitan waiter !! He made us feel at home\n",
      "Excellent treatment, you eat very well\n",
      "Thank you very much x dinner. We enjoyed ourselves as children. We made the \"steak menu\" and I must highlight the quality of the products, how they are cooked and their presentation all this with very good attention x part of the staff.For me a 10, we will be back\n",
      "Fantastic quality and attention.It is one of the best restaurants with embers.The meat is 10, the vegetables, seasonal dishes and the delicious desserts. It is highly recommended.\n",
      "Truly a cozy and pleasant place, recommended for Italians as the waitress speaks it perfectly. Really good quality food, try the grilled duck and the creme brulee. The initial appetizer and the local liqueur offered at the end were very welcome\n",
      "Good daily menu with a good price and a lot of choice.\n",
      "Cozy decorated, good treatment, fast service and good price !!!We ordered the menu (just over ‚Ç¨ 11). Fresh salad, neither abundant nor poor in quantity; The very tasty, tender and grilled meat came accompanied (paying a small supplement) with homemade potatoes. The dessert was also made by them (brownie) and despite being a little hard the top layer, it was also very good (this is the only one but I found !!). Recommended and great value for money\n",
      "We passed by here and stayed on the terrace. All great! We are not very carnivores, so we ordered cod carpaccio, sausage and broken eggs with ham, among other things. Great service, very attentive, nice place. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "Great! Great! Great! The menu is wonderful and everything has its taste of charcoal and firewood, fabulous prices compared to the quality of the dishes that is quite high, it has 3 very different environments I recommend the upper part or the entrance, then there is another one down some stairs that It is very dark and does not feel very good. Very good attention!We will be back for sure!\n",
      "All very good and the staff very attentive. The only q we had bad luck and there was a table of 3 people but very noisy. For the rest all 10 !!!!!\n",
      "The only saving grace about this site is the friendliness of the service.Pot tarama and grape leaves weren't homemade either.The lamb was tough.The octopus stew ... Reheated, burned and I don't even know if it was octopus because of the little flavor it had or red.\n",
      "Very good service and exquisite dishes üëåüèΩ\n",
      "A good place to enjoy a good meal, delicious food and excellent treatment\n",
      "The Greek tavern. Located in the neighborhood of Gracia. Torrent de l 'Olla street. It is a pleasure to dine in this place, Everything is great. It is a very well decorated minimalist place but all the decoration is Greek. That makes you transport yourself to Greece. Everything that comes out of those stoves is very good. In addition, the employees are very nice and advise you very well. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Charming and well decorated place ... Various menus to choose from at different prices, kindness and good service at a more than fair price.\n",
      "The restaurant with a super nice decoration. Super friendly and professional attention.We have been a group and for starters we shared a variety of cheeses (Pikilia Tirion) that had an exquisite jam, also Greek creams (Pikilia).An important addition to Pikilia Eli√©s, surprising varieties of Olives, if you like spicy, you will enjoy. I'm not spicy, but I took a chance. That if, BEWARE, they will cry, but they will survive.I ordered a Kalamaria Yemist√° and I really liked it. The presentation is very consistent and the taste is delicious. Another of the dishes on the table, were several Htapodi and Moussaka, I have tried them and I will return to order them for myself.\n",
      "A good place for Greek food in Barna. Meat and seafood dishes are better than fish, and the assortments of creams and cheeses are recommended.A great place for greek food in Barcelona. The meat and seafood is good, but the fish runs the risk of being dry. I would recommend the platters of cheeses and dips.\n",
      "Very nice restaurant. Very welcoming staff and excellent and abundant dishes.\n",
      "Very good place. We were calm and the food is good, and the treatment is correct.My only complaint was regarding the water, they did not tell me that it was filtered and for me it had a bad taste of tap water.\n",
      "Very average kitchen. The lamb metora very good and recommended.\n",
      "Good Greek food! The Zeus menu is worth ordering.\n",
      "The waitress looked after us very well. We commented that there was a celiac person and he helped us choose the dishes (all very good). There is also bread for celiacs. Good value for money.\n",
      "We went to lunch and grabbed the zeus menu each. Later we realized that taking the dishes separately came out at the same price as taking the menu with the difference that with the menu we could only choose the first and second options they give you and apart we could not even choose the dessert. All this counting that the filtered water costs 2 euros!In addition, the prices are without VAT !!!! Which is very small and with the mobile screen it looks even less !!. Expensive and nothing out of this world.A scam. We will not return.\n",
      "Very good food and attention.We ordered different dishes and the truth was that they were all delicious.We will be back.\n",
      "I loved it, nice place, excellent food and the store of Greek products, very stocked. Super recommended.\n",
      "A dinner in a nice place and quality food. Good explanations from the waitress about the food\n",
      "Good food and service. I didn't like the letter saying \"price + VAT\". If it weren‚Äôt for the gang we had a reservation for, I wouldn‚Äôt have come in for that. I had a good dinner for a reasonable price and once I had paid, I told the waitress that it was not right to put prices without VAT since I was already the end consumer.\n",
      "Very friendly staff. Right price quality. I recommend the meatball.\n",
      "Very good food, incredible lamb and musaka and he danced spectacularly. The only downside is that they take a long time to serve you, there is only one waitress.\n",
      "A great restaurant. And the perfect service. Great food\n",
      "Fast food restaurant, well stocked, though, and good.Please note that the letter does not include VAT, which as far as I know is illegal\n",
      "The service of the waitresses very friendly! The downside was the menu (Aphrodite) that costs you almost ‚Ç¨ 30 per couple to try two very weak tasting dishes! Not worth it :(\n",
      "A quiet place, little crowded with a daily menu at a reasonable price. The food is good, for my taste it lacks quantity (perhaps that would raise the price). If you are one of those who enjoy nuances and do not need large quantities, you can enjoy it.\n",
      "For the price that costs you, it is better to go eat a paella or rice with lobster elsewhere. You have a giant daily menu drop down in front of you and the waitress tells you that there is no daily menu. He recommends the Aphrodite menu (a scam): first sauces with a meager bread ration and second kebab meat. Neither drink nor dessert enter.3 Greek pastries at the price of a michelin restaurant. Never to return\n",
      "A great option to enjoy Greek delicatessens in the heart of Gr√†cia ... everything is delicious. Very cozy local and a very good deal.\n",
      "Good food at a good price. Very well made sauces.\n",
      "Cozy tavern to taste its traditional food. Great service.\n",
      "Good place to change the routine.The food is plentiful, good and varied. Good Greek restaurant.The normal decoration with details.\n",
      "Everything we have eaten was very tasty, a very nice place and very good service, when we return to the Gracia neighborhood, we will return!\n",
      "Good Greek food restaurant. To highlight the delicious dolmades, the melitzanosalata and the baklava for dessert! Maybe something expensive, but worth it given the quality of the dishes.\n",
      "Great food, everything great! It is not expensive, and the service very pleasant. We will be back!\n",
      "Good food, enough portions at least the Apollo menu, although a friend was left hungry. The ‚Äòkeftedes‚Äô meatballs are delicious !!\n",
      "Do not enter if it is not for the menu. We have returned out of nostalgia to know if they were still there. QR code without VAT, three starters, two dishes, average wine .... The yellow fat gyro, a dessert, in short 94 euros, not even top-notch, how disappointing. Never again, to pay this there are much better places\n",
      "Both the treatment of the brunette waitress and the food have been excellent. A very good experience that we will repeat\n",
      "Being a Thursday was not too crowded, the food was good enough, especially the mousaka.\n",
      "We ate very well, in a quiet atmosphere\n",
      "Very good service and great food üòã\n",
      "Great for trying the real Greek cuisine from Casola, simple place and really nice staff! Best day: Friday where the traditional breaking of dishes takes place followed by sirtaki !! üòç\n",
      "Good Greek food in a pleasant place in Barcelona and with a varied menu. Very attentive and friendly service. I would prefer the gyros to be served more traditional street style and with lamb meat. Recommendable.\n",
      "Excellent place to taste authentic Greek food, healthy and fresh. Highly recommended for curious palates. ;)\n",
      "All super good, the service my kind\n",
      "Value for money 3/5.Starters: nice tzatziki, the Creole cheese with tomato jam was good, but overly salty for my taste.Main courses: the stuffed squids were good, a good combination of tastes. Puff pastry stuffed with lamb meat with vegetable garnish. The meat is a dry tad, but very good and the vegetables are delicious.Dessert of the week was a kind of very good brownie and quite sweet.In general the portions seem a bit fair in quantity, but enough to be well satiated.\n",
      "A handsome restaurant, with very Mediterranean decoration! The thing is that food is not something that I couldn't make at home and I'm not Greek! It was quite tasty, it was more Italian than Greek! Excellent treatment I give 10 * very kind and correct!\n",
      "Somewhat high price but very good quality.\n",
      "Transported to Greece with fried cheese and a myth\n",
      "Right place, with attractive dishes, although there are Greek restaurants in BCN that seem more homely. The white wine is not put in an ice bucket and is easily heated.\n",
      "It was the first time that I went to a Greek and the experience was good. It is a cozy place and the treatment is good. The food was all very good, except the dessert that we did not like (assortment of Greek cakes). They were all very sweet and gooey. Overall pretty good, to repeat.\n",
      "I have gone with my two daughters and the treatment has been excellent, I encourage you to also go with the children, who try new flavors and dishes. They are very professional, they explain each dish, and the food is great !!! 100% recommendable, the price well paid.\n",
      "All great\n",
      "Excellent! Very good food and attention. Do not stop passing by the winery that is next door ... their products are excellent\n",
      "Great service. The rich food, especially the starters\n",
      "Great value for money on the menu of the day.We will be back without a doubt!\n",
      "Good dishes and Greek background music. A good place in Barcelona to enjoy a little piece of Greece !!!A very good deal, with good food and a great atmosphere.The only thing that was not clear to us was the restaurant ticket: we thought they were accepted but it turned out not. But good for the rest, very good.\n",
      "Menu of 10 euros surprised us. For the quality, flavor and abundance.\n",
      "Beautiful restaurant with very good staff. When we were ordering too much food they recommended that we slow down even though they had ended up charging more and told us all the dishes we wanted.\n",
      "Delicious food, with good attention and treatment by the staff. Excellent desserts, highly recommended Greek cakes! üòãAs the only downside, it is somewhat expensive if you order a la carte: They save ‚Ç¨ 2 something for drinks ... and it usually costs ‚Ç¨ 15-20 per person.Tip: Go when they have a lunch menu\n",
      "Good food and good price. Nice place. I hope people are encouraged to go there!\n",
      "Good dishes\n",
      "Delicious dishes and quality of ingredients. Excellent stuffed calamari, very good mussaka, and I think I ate the best vine rolls here ever. Not recommended for lactose intolerant because feta is everywhere! Fair prices. The service was also excellent .. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "There is a good quality price relation. Very good service, we will be back !!\n",
      "From Greece to Grace. All super rich and generous quantities\n",
      "Regular, variety of dishes, but a little weak. The meal without dessert 22 e.\n",
      "Everything super rich, we loved it\n",
      "Good food, a very respectful treatment and without problems to explain the dishes.\n",
      "Good place, good service and good wine\n",
      "Very rich everything, affordable price, perhaps a little scarce in quantity of bread\n",
      "I'm not going back to the Taberna Griega restaurant. I chose it for the striking menu of the day of 10 euros from Monday to Thursday. I booked online and after a few days I called to confirm. The girl who attended me could not find my reservation and pointed me again.Three of us went for lunch on Thursday. Upon arrival, he took us note of the menu of the day and served us the drinks that were included. After a while, we suppose, the owner introduces himself and tells us that having made the reservation online we cannot ask for the menu of the day. Nor can I cancel the reservation online. It gives us no other option and forces us to choose another menu from the menu. It no longer reappears. The girl does and apologizes for her mistake in taking the phone reservation and double booking. I explain that, if I now have two reservations, why can't I cancel one and enjoy the menu of the day. No, it can not be. We do not understand it when we speak and we are hungry. So without wanting to enter into debate, we let ourselves be advised and asked for the tasting menu.When we finished eating, we asked for desserts. There is no dessert on this menu ... wow ... We paid 40 euros plus drinks separately (the glass of wine 3 euros, the small bottle of water for three 2 euros), total 60 euros.Good food? Yes, it was rich without being anything extraordinary. And the service? It can be improved ... he is not at all sympathetic with the customer, deplorable treatment, and she, correct, but it is essential to inform about the dishes and what it includes or does not include and especially after what happened. No detail with the client.Tip: if you go for the 10 euro menu, do a third grade first. If not, change restaurants.\n",
      "We have had a wonderful meal. The menu is not extensive but there is a choice (mostly Greek cuisine) and in particular the cod dish has enchanted us without compromising the bream and the salads.The place is very nicely decorated and tables are served quickly and professionally.Recommended restaurant.\n",
      "Fairly good prices in a very cozy place. You eat very well and they explain the dishes to you.\n",
      "The lunch menu was meager. They are delicious, but just the right amounts of cheese. My second course looked like another starter.\n",
      "All correct and good!\n",
      "A typical Greek restaurant in Gracia, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãmany vegetarian options, very, very good, starters, salads, Greek bread and desserts a delight! Very good attention also.\n",
      "Being Greek it has not met my expectations, the Greek salad very little and poor, the ingredients of low quality, the dolmadakia were canned ... The melitzanosalata (verejena cream) that yes very rich but little quantity, pita bread 1 small portion for 4 people, the second course was rich, gemista (vegetables stuffed with rice) but the recipe did not seem typical Greek.\n",
      "Very good food. Great service. Good value for money\n",
      "Excellent Greek food. Several menus Large local. Very friendly waitress and helps you with the choice. In the heart of Grace. Bonissim tot.\n",
      "The worst menu I have ever eaten.Menu ‚Ç¨ 10, terrible quality.First, macaroni, with canned tomato as is and some pieces of feta; the other first, a baked feta cheese that only tasted like salt.The second ones also bad, meatballs and beef stew that didn't taste like anything.The only good thing was the yogurt and the waiter. Even the coffee was bad.I do not recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "Located in the heart of Gr√†cia. Cozy, informal and relaxed atmosphere. Well-cooked cuisine. Attentive and efficient service. Greek and vegetarian desserts and desserts, Greek wine and beer. Recommended place if you like Greek cuisine.\n",
      "The best Greek restaurant in Barcelona. Good and authentic food. The staff are lovely and very attentive.\n",
      "We ate 4 the Zeus menu, the first ones we put to share and the second vegetable musaka. Great everything, spectacular. We will be back for sure!\n",
      "Do you want to eat Greek? Go to Greece !!!! A disappointment .... pre-made food, bag potato, zero flavor.\n",
      "We made a food delivery order that we picked up on the premises. We loved the prawns and the musaka.Highly recommended\n",
      "Delicious and careful\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Charming place and exquisite food. Recommended quality price.\n",
      "We went to dinner, excellent attention, waiter recommended dinner and he was right, all delicious !!! we will be back soon\n",
      "We asked for the menu on the recommendation of the waitress, who was very friendly, but the place was empty, we should have already suspected ... The menu is cheap (15 ‚Ç¨) but does not include any drinks. They charge ‚Ç¨ 2 for tap water, and the food is of very low quality. Meat of dubious origin and very poor presentation: a piece of dried meat with pre-cooked frozen potatoes. A fiasco.\n",
      "The first time I try Greek food and the truth is that I have been fascinated, the excellent attention especially the girl who is in charge of taking orders, all very fast and delicious, I will definitely return. 100% recommended !!!\n",
      "The food was very good, there is a great variety in the menu, the menu of the day is large and excellent service\n",
      "Cozy, excellent food and very reasonable prices\n",
      "Very rich! The puff pastry stuffed with lamb and the musaca very rich both ... I did not have time to photograph it!\n",
      "Awesome! Pikilia and Moussaka are delicious! It is also highly recommended to try Retsina wine. The waiter is very friendly and advises very carefully.\n",
      "We went to eat at noon. Delicious Greek food, good atmosphere and great attention. We will be back soon! We recommend the Greek cheese plate, excellent!\n",
      "Very polite and attentive waitress\n",
      "The restaurant reflects the Mediterranean beauty of Ancient Greece. Very well furnished. Welcoming and friendly staff. Excellent appetizers based on various types of creams and prawns in kataifi paste. I highly recommend!\n",
      "The take away pitas can be improved. The bread is the basic one (not the thick one that Greeks sometimes put in) and, also, they gave us a little cold. I prefer the Quick Greek in terms of take away. Although the dishes to eat in the restaurant looked good.\n",
      "Unfortunately the quality of the food has deteriorated. We order take away gyros, it doesn't have pita bread but kebab. The spanakopyta very dry and oily. Dry swordfish, tasteless, very meager portion.I do not recommend it.\n",
      "Good Greek food. Good atmosphere and very attentive waiter, we enjoyed dinner and also desserts. Frankly highly recommended. We will be back!!!\n",
      "Great Greek food ...Spectacular deal with very little wait.I recommend it 100%.\n",
      "Takeaway food pretty good. I should mention the moussaka made with authentic Greek ingredients. We ordered a bottle of white wine from Greece and it was very good. Recommended for lovers of Greek cuisine.\n",
      "Excellent Greek food. Dishes for all tastes and very tasty. Excellent atention.\n",
      "A mediocre restaurant with a very unprofessional service, the waitress did not know how to uncork a bottle or serve the dishes properly. If it was so rookie Maybe I should be more supervision of a partner profesional..Deben do believe that customer a favor by serving oily imitation of Greek food and characterless. When reading my sincere review they have answered with a scorn, instead of initiating a self-criticism. In fact I ended up in that restaurant because it was the most empty of that sector of grace. Inadvisable. As I can see after my review it seems that they have tried ... Or that all their friends have valued upwards. It is the unreliability of these critical systems.\n",
      "It's a pity that fewer and fewer people go there, a unique place in Barcelona\n",
      "Excellent attention, quality products.\n",
      "Fast and efficient service. It has a very sunny terrace to have breakfast or snacks. The offer is not very varied and the prices are quite high, but it is the best way to visit the museum or attend events and congresses without having to make long trips outside the premises.\n",
      "I can only comment as a cafeteria bar, although it is a restaurant and offers a la carte food. It is quite spacious, it has a large terrace. I had a queue to eat. It is a good place to have a cool drink after visiting the museum.\n",
      "Family restaurant to go with the kids without worrying.The food, good. The salad was NOT cool at all. Very successful hummus. The very rich Melos. The chocolate, walnut and banana cake .. mmmm ...\n",
      "The restaurant is located in the museum grounds, sharing space with the cafeteria. It is a bit noisy and there are usually quite a lot of people, the food was good. Something that I really liked and that I value is the vegetarian option, both in the first and in the second.\n",
      "Excellent restaurant to serve CosmoCaixa visitors. The space is huge and very well lit. The service is good and attentive. The prices are very adequate and the food is delicious! We have tried a sandwich, sweet pork, Russian salad and chocolate cake for dessert, all wonderful!\n",
      "Very correct food, well presented and very well cooked. Too bad that with COVID it only works 50% with a better distribution of the tables and with the immensity of space they have more people could enter. Highly recommended price-quality. To improve: more dishes to choose from on the menu. 4 first and 4 second is a fair hair.\n",
      "Consistent, tasty, well-organized and well-organized menu (starter, main course, drink and desserts). Good service and excellent value for money, I paid 13.95 euros for everything (a great value for Barcelona).\n",
      "Varied menu and good price. The letter is fine. So you don't have to complicate yourself looking for another place if you are going to spend the day .. a very nice deal ..\n",
      "The food was very good however, a camer ma told me it was smaller than my friend Joaquim and ma changed his paper cup for my glass cup, indignant. Pos date we have been 2 years.\n",
      "The service is unprofessional. Seasonal people, not waiters.\n",
      "Very nice restaurant, both space and staff, and high quality daily menu at a very fair price.\n",
      "Restaurant with Alma Bonita in the center of Barcelona\n",
      "The price is tight.The service is good.It's very clean.COVID measures are well followed.It has a large restaurant indoors and also has a terrace.The pity is that the menu is very small and the cheeseburger is quite improvable in quality of ingredients.Desserts could be cheaper (cheese cake).They have gluten-free and vegan food.\n",
      "I don't recommend it, and I'm talking about the cosmocaixa restaurant, eh? What below I have seen reviews with photographs that does not belong to this restaurant. The one in Cosmocaixa is worth nothing, we ask for a daily menu in which we order hummus, sweet pork and chocolate cake and on the other hand children's menu of macaroni and tomato ... Well the hummus (and look, I'm very humus) fatal, salty and honestly bad taste. The honeyed pork is saved, it could be eaten. The chocolate cake shows that it was not homemade so it was good. Let's talk about the children's menu, horrible! The children were spitting out that food and I am not surprised since I tasted it and it was sour, pasty, tasteless ... It says a lot about a cook who does not know how to make something as simple as macaroni. IM not coming back anymore.\n",
      "Seventh closed by the pandemic. You can bite into something in the cafeteria but ... it's nothing out of the ordinary.\n",
      "We had lunch on weekdays and found it a bit pricey.\n",
      "Well, what to say ........ Before it was an open buffet, of great quality and diversity. Now because of the pandemic, or so I think, it is menu and scarce and not very elaborate. We have had a problem with raw salmon ....... the treatment very well. But I do not recommend it. A shame\n",
      "Kind and hospitable. Great sandwiches. Very low prices: 2 large sandwiches (with ham and cheese, delicious) and 2 radlers, in total 10 euros.\n",

      "Good service and quality food, only it would be nice to have more options on the menu\n",

      "Bad experience. Very bad organization when sitting down, food arrives cold and there are few staff. It should improve the quality of service.\n",
      "Highly recommended!\n",
      "Well organized, you eat well.\n",
      "Terrible attention, the man who treats us in a bad tone and with bad manners. The kitchen won't be open until 1:00 p.m., there are children who eat earlier than that and the offer before 1:00 p.m. unhealthy food cold sandwiches, donate yourself, pastries, potato chips ... if you can eat elsewhere or take your own own better.\n",
      "Good place to eat, it is within the Cosmocaixa enclosure\n",
      "Not recommended food\n",
      "Changes by Covid theme very well. Very correct price quality, even more so for Museum cafeteria.Friendly staff. Varied food offer. Brave potatoes that really are potatoes.\n",

      "Very well attended, and the menu, well presented and everything very good. I'll be back when I can.\n",
      "To have a drink and order a tapa is fine. But eating leaves a lot to be desired. I have ordered the quinoa salad and I have not been able to eat it. The macaroni also very fair.\n",
      "Good sandwiches and very successful children's dishes! Very familiar place and very affordable prices.\n",
      "Menu with a good quality price\n",
      "In the adult menu, there is not much to choose from: and the child's lettuce does not go through a health check, it had been recommended to me, but I really did not like it very much.\n",
      "Very correct good service\n",
      "Excellent cafeteria\n",
      "Barely enough restaurant due to covid restrictions\n",
      "We were thinking of having a coke and some potatoes, but we stayed to eat because the prices were very good.Very good food and generous portions. We did not expect much because it was very cheap, but we left very happy because it meets the 3 Bs: Good, Nice and Cheap! Also very friendly waiters\n",
      "They take advantage of tourism a bit, they are expensive.\n",
      "Very friendly staff\n",
      "The truth, I was very surprised. It has quite generous portions and my children have really enjoyed the food. It is worth coming here, apart from seeing a super cool museum you eat very well and have a very good service\n",
      "Value for money very well, they have a free buffet that is very good and varied. For ‚Ç¨ 14 I do not know what people expect, I think that more attention, which is excellent, earns a good grade. There is something on the menu such as Andalusian squid (real squid) that were very good. If I return to the museum I will repeat. I recommend it.\n",
      "A good place to eat when visiting Cosmocaixa. Buffet service, with good salads and more than acceptable second courses. Good service and reasonable price. The place is large and spacious, there is room for happiness to move around and go for food.\n",
      "Bufete flowing, with few things. It's the 3rd time I went there and it's lost in quality and quantity. To continue visiting the museum and eat something na is okay. Very correct service\n",
      "There is no letter to see prices, what less a qr code on the table to know what you pay, right? No chocolate croissant left :(.\n",
      "Reasonable price (much cheaper than downtown)Good tasteSweet fruitDrinking with waterDo not understand why the evaluation is not very high\n",
      "Good value for money, considering that it is a place full of families with children, they have a sufficiently complete self-service meal offering and different options so that children do not eat the usual children's menu (escalope with chips). Efficient service, too much even if you get the dish without finishing if you mess up!\n",
      "Quality very good price\n",
      "Passable food and limited assortment but, honestly, considering the null offer that there is for the surroundings and the prices of the cafeteria it is worth eating there. The staff is friendly and the place is comfortable and they were kind enough to adapt the prices to the ages of my daughters. The little girl of two years did not pay and the one of 4 only half something that is to be appreciated.At another time of the year where the heat is not so stifling it is worth going to the picnic area when visiting the museum\n",
      "Restaurant with free buffet perfect for families. The staff is very attentive and the food is varied and good.\n",
      "Bad food and little assortment. If you like the salad you can eat lettuce there is a lot but little more\n",
      "The experience was not good. The dishes do not say what they bring and when we wanted to change one for an allergy theme they refused. Where have you seen\n",
      "There is a good quality price relation. Ideal to go with children.\n",
      "For the cost of the buffet I found it very fair and bland.\n",
      "I enjoyed a great meal and a great experience and I recommend totom\n",
      "Excellent food and good treatment ...\n",
      "Crap. Food for the sick. Few options of dishes. Excessively expensive. You better buy two sandwiches at the bar. I will eat better and I will not spend that barbarity. A theft!!\n",
      "The truth is that the buffet food is bad. I'm sorry because they are workers who are there to give the service. But pay almost 15 euros and find refried potatoes and hard raw fideua. The food I'm sorry but it has no quality to charge you what they charge you. We've gone 3 times to eat and it's just the same. Bad kitchen. Desserts are saved and salad theme ... everything else leaves much to be desired It is not well cooked. It is clear that it is better that you take something to eat picinic d.At least we do not repeat.\n",
      "I attended a chubby boy but chubby very good attention and it is worth the price, very fast\n",

      "to eat something quick and continue visiting the museum\n",
      "Delicious excellent food\n",
      "Scarce assortment, horrible quality, poor cooking and all for ‚Ç¨ 14 per head.Fatal.\n",
      "Very expensive I saw it ... very poor quality .. very bland food and some raw things .. have a lot to improve the truth\n",
      "As a passable catering, lazy paella, but not leaving the center that there is nothing around it is the best option.The waiters who just empty the plate remove it from you\n",
      "Buffet restaurant: The only good thing is the attention and the coffee. Unfortunate food in all areas, from cold starters to hot ones, passing through the children's. There was nothing to save, not even the price or the space. Eat anywhere else and you will be right.\n",
      "I did not like it at all, I do not recommend that you go very bad service.\n",
      "I do not recommend the macaroni nor the cat eats them, they are very bad the only good thing is the coffee, it is also an impossible mission to take a table.\n",
      "Fast food restaurant with a higher quality than Burger King or McDonalds but exaggerated prices. The quality of the product is good, with a very tasty meat, and the decoration reminds the locals of the 50/60, but paying 52 euros for four hamburgers, four drinks and two potatoes for me is disproportionate. One good thing they have is that you can choose from 100 drink combinations that you can refill as many times as you want.\n",
      "I liked it, good for them! Exquisite potatoes.\n",
      "Large place with two floors and what to say about burgers and smoothies ... delicious! I recommend the cajun potatoes.\n",
      "It won‚Äôt be the cheapest burger you eat, but it sure will be one of the best. Quality ingredients with a high capacity for customization.\n",
      "This is a five guys hot-dog. Appalling. And it is not that you are cheap.\n",
      "Fast food at set menu prices, from any of the restaurants around the mall. I see it too expensive for a hamburger and fries. To my opinion.\n",
      "Good food, a little expensive, but the burgers are good, also the potatoes, very homemade.The guy who attended us very kindly explained how everything worked.\n",
      "Good experience. You arrive, you order your hamburger (better double because they are small) you put the toppings or sauces you want because they are free. Very good potatoes and free refillable machine drink. What I did not like at all is that they serve you the hamburger in aluminum foil. It is a useless waste of paper, better in a tray and now\n",
      "I was expecting better quality overall.The smoothie is very dense, the cardboard straw lasts a few minutes before falling apart, the taste very monotonous, it just tasted like peanut butter despite having other ingredients. The variety of the menu is quite limited and the service is not fast.I will not come back.\n",
      "10 burgers and the amazing bacon chocolate shake! Attention of 10 by the workers !! And punctual both in the restaurant and in home delivery\n",
      "We have come to try it and the truth is that we really liked it!The potatoes are crazy! The delicious Milkshake and the person in charge of duty, a love of person, super attentive and nice.\n",
      "I have had a problem with the Glovo order, I have been able to speak directly with the establishment and they have been super decisive. I have forgotten to ask the name of the girl who has attended me to be able to thank her. Great attention and food.\n",
      "The main product is quality but that's it. The rest of the experience would be fine if the prices were better, but for me pay ‚Ç¨ 14 for a hamburger, water and potatoes served on silver paper and cardboard bags ... And if you stay for lunch or a tray they will put you. Finally good product but very regular overall experience for the price. For those ‚Ç¨ 14 you go to Fosters Hollywood where they have a similar or better product, served on a plate by a waiter, much more variety, and in a more cozy place. Where is it going to stop?\n",
      "Good attention, the air conditioning does not work, the bathroom was very dirty; As for the food Good burgers and rich hot dogs, a variety of drinks with the soda machines, the potatoes were inedible cold burnt and chewy!\n",
      "Typical American hamburger restaurant, high quality products, they stand out because their fries are made with peanut oil and because they have Coca-Cola with a lot of flavors, you will not be able to resist trying them all!\n",
      "Generally well especially the drinks. The hamburgers are good but they are nothing of the other world, the meat does not ask you how you want it, they give it a good time. For that price there are much better places.1 Large Hamburger (same as the small one but with two hamburgers inside)1 Normal burger1 medium potato2 soft drinks1MilkshakeAll this ‚Ç¨ 33\n",
      "Very good quality burger. Designed 100% to everyone's taste.The price is very affordable. Five Guys style potatoes are very good. And there are always free peanuts. But what I enjoy most, since it does not exist anywhere else, are with drinks:Original Coca-Cola machines where you can find many different types that are not marketed in Spain. In addition these machines also have the other drinks in the house like Fanta, Sprite, Aquarius, etc. of many different flavors.To personal taste, my favorite is the loan fanta. üòâ\n",
      "The burgers are delicious and the shakes with \"original\" flavors too. I recommend it.\n",
      "A little expensive to be fast food. The ingredients are better than in other fast food.\n",
      "The truth that I expected much more. I do not know if I'm used to some bigger hamburgers but I've known a little. Although one can put the 15 toppings for free! In short, the big place and I liked to put stairs for people to do a little exercise. The soda machines I think are original & the option of spicy potatoes too.\n",
      "Super good! The price is very good for what you get. Genuine burgers, perfect attention and fast service. The crunchiest bacon I've ever tasted in my life. The potatoes are with skin and they are delicious, you have all the drink and sauces you want (refillable glasses). There is also an unlimited supply of roasted peanuts (really good, really, and saladets).I will repeat.\n",
      "I do not usually put 5 stars anywhere, but the quality of the Hamburger and the different flavor of the potatoes makes me put it, I have gone to many hamburgers but it has something different. To start you order the hamburger and you can put the topings or ingredients you want except the cheese that is paid separately and that is brutal. The potatoes are made with super rich peanut oil, the different flavor is noticeable and then you can refill the drink as many times as you want. For you to know, the service it has is just to give you the food, there is no table service. One of the drawbacks that this establishment has in the machinist, is that it has an upstairs and has no beverage dispensers in the area above. 100% recommended\n",
      "Great fast food restaurant. Delicious American typical hamburgers. The delicious fries! Refillable drink Price-quality very acceptable!Highly recommended!\n",
      "DO NOT THINK ABOUT IT ... VERY EXPENSIVE ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ .. WHAT THEY GIVE YOU DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE PRICES THEY CHARGE YOU .. THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OFFERED AND 30 MINUTES OF WAITING ... THE MISERABLE HABURGUESA. .A PIECE OF LETTUCE AND A PIECE OF TOMATO ... POTATOES WERE PURE SALT ... IN THE END, SEE THE PHOTOS ... HAVING GOOD ARTISAN BRANDS WHY GO TO THIS CHAIN? .. (BURGESA..TGB ... ETC ..)\n",
      "Burgers are one of the best I've had, a large selection of drinks with and without sugar, you pay as much as you like and drink freely. The service is fairly fast for the number of people in the restaurant. Delicious peanuts üòÅ\n",
      "The place is spacious and clean, but it is excessively expensive. The hamburger was really good, but I find it too expensive that you have to pay ‚Ç¨ 12 for a hamburger and a drink.I don't think I'll come back, it's still a burger shop of so many\n",
      "It seems a bit expensive ...\n",
      "Rich hamburgers, good attention. But that they only sell you Budweisser or Corona beer and at ‚Ç¨ 4, I think it's very bad. The burgers maybe a little small, but good taste.\n",
      "Our favorite üòçüòçüòçü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ amazing attention. The price is well above the US and Madrid itself, but ... what are we going to do. We change it for peanuts üòúüçîüçüüå≠\n",
      "Very good deal. They made the food in record time. The burgers are double meat. There are medium and large and all toppings are free. There is an area to serve ketchup and mayonnaise. Make less area to fill the drink on the second level.\n",
      "I love this place it's total american food ... For starters the fries are natural not frozen and they put you where they are from. The delicious burger the good meat and the delicious complements and they are free. While you wait you can eat free cacaotes !!!! And you have American or Mexican beers ... The prices are good and they are quick to serve, to go with ideal children ... You can not ask for more if you want to taste UUEE !!!! Five guys in the machinist !!!!\n",
      "Finally Barcelona has a Five Guys. We had already tried it sometime in NY and it never disappoints. The potatoes are the best, both normal and Cajun. Good burgers with better quality than other fast food chains. The negative point was taken by the shakes. They boast of having good shakes and the two we ordered tasted like cream and not oreo for example. They were totally white. I think this point should be improved.\n",
      "I have come because the hamburgers are super good as are the shakes, but today I tried the Bacon hot dog that is worth ‚Ç¨ 6.50 very expensive for how little and terrible it is. Horrible and disappointing. For now I would not return.\n",
      "A little expensive peeeeero ... the hamburger tastes like hamburger that is very important! Refillable drink!By the way those potatoes with coconut oil\n",
      "Simple and efficient menu, with fresh products, prices a little high, good\n",
      "Excellent service, incredible place, excellent hamburger, normal hamburger, 1 normal hamburger (double) and a small one, small potatoes and a soda with refill. ‚Ç¨ 23.50 peanuts are free.The real five guys experience, great service, great food, great decor, high prices, still worth it.\n",
      "The product is good but the format to eat there is terrible. In a bag, the potatoes in a glass and that makes it very stressful to eat like this\n",
      "Rich burgers and tasty potatoes (cooked with peanut oil). They have a stipulated price and then you can add all the ingredients you want from a list (such as grilled mushrooms, lettuce, onion, a variety of sauces, etc).Like the drink, if you decide on a soda, you have \"open bar\" and where to choose from more than 100 different ones üòÖThey have plus, free peanuts!\n",
      "Perhaps the quality / price ratio is not the most appropriate, for the price of the hamburger, without counting the drink or potatoes separately, we find other better options at La Maquinista. The quality of the burger is good. When paying for the drink, the possibility of refilling it more times is appreciated. Covid measures are well met, respecting spaces\n",
      "The best Fast Food of hamburgers. It's more expensive than the other Fast Food, but it's that they have hamburgers tastes and size hamburgers and some potatoes are much better than competition.\n",
      "For a fast food chain it has quality, the potatoes and hamburgers have nothing to do with those of MC Donald's or Burger King, that's the good thing, the bad thing is that it is very expensive since it does not have menus, you have to ask for things loose and only the hamburger already costs 7 euros, there is not much variety, only veal, no chicken. You can fill your drink as much as you want like in the Burger King\n",
      "Excellent attention. The hamburgers are excellent but if you eat little I recommend the mini ones, since the normal ones are with double thick meat and with that the price is already justified. If you also add all the ingredients, you will have a phenomenal hamburger !!. The potatoes are very good and with medium ones, it is enough for two people. You can fill your drink as many times as you want, so it is enough if you buy a glass when you go as a couple hahaha. It goes without saying that the price quality is worth it.\n",
      "Simply spectacular and brutal !! The burgers are great but you can also choose 12 different toppings and you can put them all at no additional cost! The soft drinks are refillable and have all the flavors you can imagine, Sprite strawberry flavor, etc. For me the best burger I have tasted in a long time. Brutal\n",
      "If you are a maverick rebel fed up with the hamburger monopoly of Mac Donald's and Burger King in Five Guys there is a corner for you.French fries in peanut oil, milkshakes with infinite complements and grilled hamburgers made as God intended, all wrapped in an informal and avant-garde atmosphere. If you go to Five Guys you will fall in love with the hamburger concept again.A bonus for those attentive and nice employees!\n",
      "Five Guys, American hamburger chain famous because the owner offers free peanuts while you wait for your hamburger, and also because the potatoes are fried with the oil of this fruit.The burgers are good but they are somewhat expensive:üçî ‚Ç¨ 5.75 Litle hamburguer.üçî 6'50 ‚Ç¨ \"Litle cheese hamburguer.üçü 3 ‚Ç¨ small potatoes.ü•§ ‚Ç¨ 3 Drink, you can serve yourself as many times as you like.I recommend üíØ%.\n",

      "The Cajun potatoes are delicious, and with the small measure, there is more than enough to be satisfied. As for the hamburger ... it leaves a lot to be desired for the price it has. You can put the ingredients you want for the same price, but I expected more flavor because of the restaurant's fame. Drinks of many different flavors and free peanuts are points in favor.I paid a total of ‚Ç¨ 13 for a small hamburger, small Cajun potatoes and drink.\n",

      "The only good thing are the smoothies that are expensive and the flavored drinks ... the super simple burger ... and we are talking about a hamburger from 7 to 9 turkeys ..... over valued ... that's if the paws you pay for it aside ... you see preparing the cash chato ....\n",
      "The burger is not bad but nothing to get excited about, fast food style, very similar to the burger king, too expensive for what it is. The drink is also somewhat expensive, the Brooklyn beer 5 eurazos ...\n",

      "Perfect hamburgers, you can add all the condiments they have completely free. The place complies with the regulatory sanitary regulations, it generates a lot of safety to eat inside the place.

      "The burger was very good and the potatoes too! There is a great variety of drinks and flavors that are not usually in Spain.\n",
      "The best burgers I've ever had. Juicy and with ingredients that show that they are fresh. Cajun potatoes are a must if you like spicy food and they are delicious. For soft drinks there are some \"Coca-Cola Freestyle\" machines where you choose the drink base (coca cola, Sprite, fanta, aquarius ...) and then the flavor (various fruits, vanilla). There is a flavor that is vanilla - cherry, which is the one I always take with coke. This is great. They also make smoothies and you have a peanut open bar !! In both hamburgers and shakes, you pay for the product you want and then you have free toppings from a list. In the hamburgers are onion, grilled onion, grilled mushrooms, pickles, jalape√±os (eye, fresh and crispy, not from a pot), relish (chopped pickles), tomato, lettuce, pepper, hot sauce, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, meat sauce ... And I don't know if I left something behind. In the shakes they are oreo, peanut butter and others that I can't remember. You can add cream Tb.Regarding the treatment, I have been like 10 times and it has always been exemplary. Very nice people who clarify any questions.It is a fast food place where you eat as you would at home if you were an expert in hamburgers.I plan to come back like 10,000 more times\n",

      "I was going back to America for a while! Very friendly staff, and delicious food! Maybe I was expecting a cheaper movie! But it is worth it for the quantity of potatoes, quality of the meat and refillable drink. I hope they open in the city center !!\n",
      "The product is good and of quality, although given the fame, I expected more from the burgers. In my opinion the price is excessive.Clean premises, comply with the covid-19 protection measures.The friendly staff but I do not like that they constantly stop by your table to ask you if you want a smoothie or something else when you are calmly with your companion at your table.\n",
      "Sorry to say this a good site but we have stolen food at dinner, on the 2nd floor of the restaurant we stole a bag and responsible nor bothered to help or report the fact we had to go to mossos.\n",
      "To highlight the potatoes (of course) although it is necessary to advise in case of ordering them with Cajun species that they do not come up because it is really spicy. The chocolate peanut butter shake leaves me speechless every time I order it ...\n",
      "Expensive, but it eats well enough to be a fast food\n",
      "For the first time I have tried the food of five guys.The price is quite high since only the hamburger comes at 9.49 and the cheeseburger at ‚Ç¨ 9.95, you have to buy separately the potatoes and a drink that in the end has added almost double what you would pay in Burger King or McDonald‚Äôs.Theirs if that the quality is higher than in the other fast foods and remarkable.I have loved the drink machine that has many combinations and that I knew for 4 years at Burger King in Madrid and I have only seen it at Burger King in the port, here in Barcelona. Coke zero / zerozero lime has a very good flavor.\n",
      "It had been several years since he had eaten at Five Guys and he remembered the hamburger better. The bacon is the richest it has, the rest does not have much flavor.\n",
      "The first time that I have been to a FIVE GUYS, and the truth that without words. Very good quality, attention etc ... Very good hamburgers and even more potatoes. We ordered lotus cookie milkshake and it was also spectacular. People complain about the loose potatoes in the bag, which does not bother me in particular, what's more, I appreciate it because if you want more, you have it in the bag! To repeat without a doubt!\n",
      "It's fast food ... but I can't say anything bad, I love the food there, very good service in this place\n",
      "We will not be back. Even MC donald has a better presentation of burgers.Expensive for the food that is. The Sandwich is presented on a hamburger bun\n",
      "I recommend it. I recently passed by, it was the first time in five guys and everything is great, a super rich place to eat super recommended hamburgers !!\n",
      "First time I go there and I don't think I'll come back. The meat leaves much to be desired, the burger breaks below and the smoothie is so dense that you can't drink it in a straw. Also, the way you serve it (in a packed bag) is very crap for the price you pay. The service, yes, very friendly.\n",
      "Excellent Place for real American style burgers. Premium natural ingredients. Potatoes are great because they are natural and are cut on the spot. Smoothies and soft drinks with refills of various flavors. Coca-Cola vanilla and cherry I recommend it. You need RootBeer to be able to say that they are 100% American\n",
      "Spectacular food, quality, attention, prices, it is a food chain that never ceases to amaze\n",
      "All very good\n",
      "It's basically packed so you can choose whether to eat inside or take it outside. I see why it's more popular than in-and-out burgers and wet burgers. In particular, the staff who was calculating late hours on the evening of 24th of July were kind. All the food was so good that it had a mild flavor of peanut. Enjoy s size fries, cheeseburgers all the way, and drinks with cola!\n",
      "The food is little and not cheap, but it tastes good\n",
      "All very good, much higher quality than MacDonalds and BurgerKing.Unlimited very varied drinks.Right price for good quality.\n",
      "Best burger fast food chain in Europe! Excellent price performance! Fresh, delicious and highly customizable burgers. Each ingredient can be used variably. At the milkshakes they also have over 1000 possible combinations. Hotdogs, burger, sandwiches and the tastiest fries are available. The small fries are enough for 2-3 people because they pack a lot in the bag. Drinks can be filled up again. Peanuts can be taken for free as many as you want. Nice staff, clean dining room and clean toilets.\n",
      "I loved. Only downside the price a note of 60 euros for a family of 4 for a fast food that surprises.\n",
      "Although somewhat over priced, it does have excellent burgers and fries. And the hamburger has no seasoning limit (vegetables and sauces). The staff is friendly, and you can try 100 different flavors of Coke.What I didn't like about the last visit is the removal of the complimentary peanuts. I understand reducing contact to minimize risk of coronavirus, but they could at least have it on request.\n",
      "Was good. But there are much better burgers. And other Five Guys stores were better too\n",
      "A fast food chain with a quality far superior to that of its competitors. They may not seem to have much variety in hamburgers, puppies or sandwiches, but the high level of customization (no cost) is wonderful. The soda machine, pure fantasy with flavors that we don't usually find in Spain (and also more normal flavors for more traditional people), delicious fries (with optional cajun) and milkshakes are excellent (and with the possibility of adding bacon You have to try it, because it is better than it seems). Prices are somewhat high compared to other chains but, for me, it is totally justified\n",
      "And I went for the first time to eat at this place and my mother what good attention from the girl Ariadna, she has taken care of us wonderfully and very kind and cordial\n",
      "Very friendly treatment. Potatoes are pretty good\n",
      "If you want to eat a typical American hamburger this is the place, great !!! But a tad expensive that if ...\n",
      "Very good quality\n",
      "Fantastic. One for the expensive for what it is, but it must be said that the quality of the food is excellent and the beers they have as well. I ordered the small (brutal) cajun potatoes and I couldn't finish them, in the photo they don't all appear that fell inside the bag.\n",
      "You can eat it.\n",
      "Apart from the food that was very good, I put a 10 to the service of the workers. It was the first time we went and an Andalusian waiter explained everything they offered in detail and a lot of grace, congratulations!\n",
      "The tasteless meat, the potatoes very well made and served in any way thrown in the bag, the bacon pasadisim a shoe sole, an experience NOT to return .....\n",
      "A massacre\n",
      "I love these hamburgers.\n",
      "Average, friendly staff, the best shakes in the world\n",
      "The food is not put delicate in the bag. Besides, the price is very expensive and the size of the hamburgers, and the most, are very small, I do not recommend that place.\n",
      "With so much publicity I thought they were real hamburgers. But it is another fast-food, a little better than McDonald's.The price of bacon cheeseburger is 10eur. In a real burger restaurant the prices are around 12-15eur. So I consider it to be a bit expensive.But I like that there are many drink options and there is vanilla coke (Yum).\n",
      "Good atmosphere, good service, good burgers. Perfect place to go if you are in a hurry.\n",
      "Exorbitant price .... ‚Ç¨ 9 for a hamburger of the same quality as a burguerking wrapped in silver foil ... If you ask for potatoes they will serve you thrown in the bag along with the rest you have ordered. I said exorbitant price, nothing to recommend\n",
      "We have ordered x deliveroo, the truth is that everything is very good! Great burger and cajun fries! and the fast delivery man! in 20 min we had it at home! we will repeat!\n",
      "The best burger I've ever had, and the worst hotdog I've ever had too ... what things life has.\n",
      "I had been in the new york, and it is not as expensive as aki. The burgers and the spectacular potatoes, but expensive! 3 burgers one of potatoes and three drinks ‚Ç¨ 40\n",
      "Good food, acceptable price\n",
      "Very good fast chain burger joint, they have some quality compared to other brands. There are usually peanuts to nibble on while you wait for your order and the beverage machine has a great variety\n",
      "I love Five Guys burgers. I think they are the best (franchise chain). The french fries are delicious too. The price somewhat high.Of this particular store, the attention of ten stands out. All great, fast and very clean establishment.\n",
      "Here and anywhere in the world my favorite hamburgers. Unpretentious gourmet or excessive combinations of flavors, a pure and hard burger with the ingredients you must have. You choose from its wide variety of 18 options: 1 or 18. The French fries come in various sizes and of course I ask for the largest one so that they never run out. While you wait for your order, you can eat all the peanuts you want well roasted and salted. Diversity of beverages also included beers. Merengadas or shakes are very good and generous in quantity. It's hard for me to eat a hamburger now that it's not in I had guys.\n",
      "The best burgers\n",
      "Much more expensive than other fast food restaurants near the place, without noticing the quality. While it is true that the difference is the amount of toppings that can be added to the burgers at zero cost. You can repeat the drink as many times as you like.\n",
      "The best hamburger in the world, typical American\n",
      "Very good especially the bacon burger, great variety of drinks and good treatment.\n",
      "The burgers are very good, good bread, incredible meat, crispy bacon.\n",
      "I had heard very good reviews and it was really disappointing. Of the worst burgers I can remember and the absurdly expensive prices. The only thing that would stand out is the attention of the staff and that the meat seems to be quality.\n",
      "This is the second time I come and delighted with your attention and products ... The delicious hamburger, the spectacular potatoes ... Even the peanuts with a special flavor. Rating is 10!\n",
      "The burgers are very good and the prices are reasonable. It is a good fast food place. The only thing I do not give 5 stars is because it lacks some cleaning in the room, especially on tables and floor.\n",
      "The worst hamburger I had in my life, the wet bread, cold, falling apart, horrible in taste, the potatoes thrown in the bag, and the advertised prices do not include VAT. I ordered 2 burgers (normal size) a large potatoes and two soft drinks ‚Ç¨ 32 euros. EXPENSIVE, for what they charged me, I had very high expectations.I would not pay 15 euros. I stay with Mc donals or La Burguesa.Debut and farewell, with experience, I do not recommend it at all.\n",
      "They are the best burgers for me, being franchise their taste is different better than those of the competitions, the potatoes are special, the service and attention very good. They attend quickly the price is higher than others but it is worth it!\n",
      "I loved. Delicious hamburger, super rich fries. Good attention and very fast everything. I will come back for sure.\n",
      "Very very fast and everything is set in a typical American hamburger restaurant they give you peanuts more than 100 refillable drinks and very good quality hamburgers\n",
      "From now on, my favorite hamburger\n",
      "Very good service, good burger but the price a bit expensive\n",
      "Eat well, but very expensive. The service is always running and always mistaking something.\n",
      "Best fast food ever = D very good hamburger, milkshake and fries.\n",
      "Amazing, as always üíú\n",
      "Quite expensive for what it is. Fast food somewhat better than other places, but at a much higher price.\n",
      "We went to test with the children. They have different sizes of Burger and you can add the ingredients you want, sauces, onion, lettuce, the large one has 2 pieces of meat and is around ‚Ç¨ 9.5 and the little one about ‚Ç¨ 6.5. The meat is good and they taste good homemade \"not pre-fab.\"We also order potatoes, a large portion for everyone is a good idea. They are homemade potatoes with skin that are the success. They cost ‚Ç¨ 5.5 approx.They have a hot dog option too.One of the attractions of the place is that there are soft drinks of different flavors, peach ... flavored colas. We did not test any. Water for everyone, I was surprised it was Evian. Beers have Coronita and Budwesier.The friendly and agile attention and price for 2 adults and 2 children was ‚Ç¨ 52 (4 burgers, 2 water, 2 beers, 1 potato) for my taste a little bit you pay the mark.\n",
      "Good hamburgueses and milkshakes, just like the ones you've seen in the United States. This is if the price is also American.\n",
      "The hamburger and the brutal Cajun potatoes, if you ask for refreshment you have the option of replenishing your glass as many times as you like in the drink machines. To make the wait more enjoyable you have boxes of cocoa to make time. Much more recommendable than other fast food chains.\n",
      "The burgers are delicious. Although afterwards you have to go to the gym to burn calories. The girl who makes them, a crack.\n",
      "Small burgers (the double \"giant\") and bland.The hot sauce was either not hot or conspicuous by its absence. Jalapenos the same.The price of the drinks, exaggerated (water: ‚Ç¨ 2, beer: ‚Ç¨ 4).Bad start.I am not going back.\n",
      "Burgers make a difference, good service, it's the best of the establishment. The only downside, they spend a bit in the price of the soft drinks.\n",
      "Very good and fresh hamburger ‚úåüòé\n",
      "We imagined hamburgers bigger. In general, the experience has been good, good atmosphere, decoration, local ... drinks of all flavors, good treatment.\n",
      "I am going to eat hamburger .. lots of sheep and a variety of toppings .. I do not even have a lot of gambit. it's delicious!!\n",
      "This is the first time I have liked it, they have very good hamburgers with spicy potatoes and smoothies üòã\n",
      "The food is good and a variety of soft drinks. Delicious milkshakes On the other hand, its high price and the excess noise that the place has\n",
      "Unbeatable customer care, you are met by a smile and serve you with all the kindness of the world. Hamburgers and fried potatoes are seemingly small but very rich and filled lot. More than satisfied. Repetiremos safe üëåüèΩ\n",
      "Good place to make a quick bite and good enough, there is enough food offer, they have their own style of making, the only drawback I find is that it seems a little expensive for what it is\n",
      "I love eating at five guys! Always a good experience. Super enthusiastic and concerned attendants to attend well. The peanuts to pinch while waiting for the order to get ready are great! I love being able to customize the sandwich and milkshake without paying extra for it. Order the coffee milkshake with chocolate. MASTER!\n",
      "The best burger I have eaten and the treatment is exceptional. In a few places I have found such a kind and attentive service. Bravo!\n",
      "Good food but a bit pricey for what it is.\n",
      "Very good treatment by the staff, very good food also the smoothies although a little expensive\n",
      "Beautiful experience!One of the most succulent sandwiches I've ever eaten.\n",
      "Rich but expensive, very beautiful inside\n",
      "Have always wanted to try their burger and I was not disappointed. It was perfect all the time but they needed to work with their french fries which were a bit boring.\n",
      "We did not like anything. It seems like a hamburger spot, but it's not worth it. The hamburgers we ordered were very tasty in bad fat. We will not go back.\n",
      "The burgers are very good and the potatoes better than at other fast food places. The staff is very attentive and recommendable, it is worth paying a little more than in other chains of the style for the quality that it offers\n",
      "American food restaurant with very good hamburgers fully customized. The quality of the product is very good and the service is correct and fast. The hamburgers and potatoes are very large, yet it is a bit expensive for what it is.\n",
      "Service fine, food idem, but what a dirty tent. Tables and floor full of junk. Music is far too loud.\n",
      "Good burgers, large and with rich meat.\n",
      "Fantastic! Potatoes very good, I ordered the small ones and there were potatoes for two or three people. The burger is good but it is expensive, especially because of the size it has. The shake is awesome. But best of all, the staff, all super attentive, polite and friendly, and all the while waiting for no one to miss anything. 10/10\n",
      "I love the place üòç the death burgers, the potatoes too, but the smoothies ... I just go to heaven with every sip. You can see the origin of the potatoes you eat.\n",
      "The burgers should be bigger, to my liking. It's cool that I can put in whatever you want ... very tasty taste,The expensive beers! 4.25 a budweiser. To drink from the spout of the bottle ...The potatoes are good.\n",
      "Excellent food, just like eating in New York! And excellent attention :)\n",
      "Very good technical service for small machinery.\n",
      "The food is great, by far, because the atmosphere is a LOT of noise.\n",
      "It is very clean and you look good, but it is very expensive to be a hamburger.\n",
      "Beautiful architecture of history and you eat very well as in all its restaurants\n",
      "Yes! Yes! Yes! Great food, the most delicious food I've ever eaten in Barcelona! I recommend! Be sure to visit this restaurant!\n",
      "Good value for money good attention air conditioning varied menu\n",
      "Clean and great service ... just great and the food was delicious\n",
      "As always quality, good service. All the premises of this franchise are very well decorated. This in particular is located in a unique building Torre Andreu (La Rotonda) with a large terrace. For cheese lovers I recommend the 7 cheese pizza.\n",
      "For me very well, I have come several times and always well, the portions are abundant and everything is very good\n",
      "Exquisite pasta and rice, great desserts, good atmosphere, very attentive staff\n",
      "Perfect to go with children. A safe value in pasta and pizza\n",
      "Good treatment, food and presentation. Highly recommended\n",
      "We sat at a table for 40 minutes to be served. Once they were served, it took another 30 minutes to bring the dishes and the waiter forgot one of the orders on the table. The food is not ugly but it is worth the wait.\n",
      "Very good quality of food and generous portions. I would say that the dishes are generally for sharing. The place is very nice and the service is very good. Being in a neighborhood somewhat away from the tourist area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, it was not so crowded and I got a table without waiting. Just for reference, we were 3 diners, we ordered a starter, 3 dishes, 2 desserts, a water, a Coke and a glass of wine. We spend 80 euros. But from the plates we had leftover food from the plates so I wouldn't say it's expensive.\n",
      "Terrible treatment by the service. They have treated us with inferiority for not being either foreigners or wealthy people. They took us a long time to ask for orders and to give us the napkins and cutlery, apart from taking about 15 minutes since we sat down, they left us in a corner and we had to distribute them ourselves, something that did not happen at the other tables. We have felt underappreciated in our own city. You are classists.\n",
      "We went to dinner on the outdoor terrace of La Rotonda, with tables and awnings with a cozy atmosphere, so cozy that when the little sun was gone when we got there, we realized that there is no light or candles in the tables. We had to read the letters with cell phone flashlights. Today, in the age of LED, it is incomprehensible that they do not put light garlands that in addition to being decorative do the function they have to do, illuminate to be able to read and be able to see what you eat.\n",
      "Nice restaurant and great dishes\n",
      "A very large room with several floors which makes it ideal for groups (business dinner, large families ...) you will find it easy to fit all the equipment. The portions are very complete, you will not be hungry and if you share a third you will not be able to do everything (but there are always people who are very hungry!). Careful desserts on presentation are almost a must to ask if you have left a hole with all the teak you have ordered before. The best I think are the pasta you can combine the type of pasta with the sauce you want! This customization will make you choose just what you like best. The pizzas for those interested are with the thin and crunchy dough, personally I love this because you notice more the taste of the ingredients than bread dough, and it is full of good quality ingredients. The attention they showed to the service was at all times pleasant and attentive. A quiet atmosphere without too much noise and space to feel comfortable without being stuck to the nearby tables. Highly recommended for both groups and couples and families.\n",
      "Dishes are well served, certainly one can for two people.\n",
      "The place of this Tagliatella is magnificent, in the heart of Bonanova.As for their meals, always in the same vein, abundant dishes and I like good pizzas. As for pasta, I find that they are not right with the sauces ... for example, they do not have any with good meat, ragout or lo Whatever ... the one with the sausage is not good and too sweet.The attention is correct, quite good for being a site with a lot of customers.\n",
      "Always good. The tranquility and the service are pleasant. In any restaurant in Spain\n",
      "the pizza dough was brick dough. the service was inattentive. the glasses were dirty and damaged. the reception was very attentive. unacceptable for a restaurant in the price and reputation range\n",
      "The food is very good but the employees start to clear the terrace an hour before they close and they hurry you to leave ... very unpleasant indeed. However the place is great\n",
      "The Tagliatela de la Rotonda is very well located, the building is beautiful and it is fantastically good on the terrace. The food as always, no surprises.\n",
      "Nice food but unacceptable staff. Rushing, they were picking up to close I imagine. 10:15 We arrived until the 11th we left around and gathered around any empty table. They made a fuss and just wanted to drive the world out. Very professional instead. They could tell us that they do not accept us after 10 K No to force us to eat with this image around us or roam around making K noise not to let us enjoy what we paid for. 1 star instead of 5 because they made us sour. Unacceptable !!!!\n",
      "Thank you Albert for the service provided. The dishes, drinks and atmosphere were great. A highly recommended place with the best host: Albert. Thanks. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Unfortunately today has not gone too well for us! Very poor service. Wrong command. Waitress with lack of preparation.Although they have wanted to be attentive but lack professionalism.\n",
      "I didn't like it at all! Poor value for money\n",
      "Great service. Excellent food as well as its quality\n",
      "Great people Albert and Kevin, the best waiters, very good vibes, we will repeat !!!\n",
      "They go from what they are not. Without grief or glory.\n",
      "Very friendly ideal to go with children\n",
      "Tagliatella. Like everyone else. This one, however, has the plus of the terrace.\n",
      "We have reserved a table outside, and everything is perfect, treatment, food, service.\n",
      "Food too abundant, it does not give you the option to try different dishes on the menu because with only one you go out to burst. The right quality, it shows that they do little in the kitchen and everything comes from the \"factory\". Of course, the decoration and the location are very good. Fast and attentive service.\n",
      "We tried the pizza and the provoleta. Exquisite everything!\n",
      "Very good service, waiters do not stop, good cuisine, very good experience.\n",
      "Italian restaurant with great quality, beautiful building location. It has a terrace outside. Delicious food but pasta was missing a cooking point. Moderate price Reception at the slow restaurant (10 min) and delay in the allocation of table with prior reservation (10 min). Friendly service but unprofessional. I would not repeat in this place.\n",
      "Of the most beautiful Tagliatellas in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãall very good, and the waiters a 10!\n",
      "They seem expensive dishes but they are worth it because they are plentiful and fresh. An excellent serviceWe have eaten divinely.\n",
      "Good restaurant. Splendid portions. It is a place with great capacity. The price is OK.\n",
      "Great treatment, unbeatable, excellent food\n",
      "A Tagliatella restaurant like any of the chain. It stands out for the newly restored building and for being in an area where there is not much to offer in restaurants. The pizzas are decent and the pasta is not bad, although it is always too well made for my taste. Salads are plentiful and varied, and you can choose from a variety of salads. Prices are expensive but it never fails and the service is fast and efficient.\n",
      "Rich pizzas, good quality price. Pizza with wine, coffee and glass. ‚Ç¨ 22 per person. The very nice terrace with security measures. Quick and attentive staff.\n",
      "The quality of always with a good service and a very beautiful place\n",
      "The pizza is too thin and very good. Very correct treatment. Space I pray too\n",
      "we went to celebrate graduation! Very good service, especially from Abdul! Very good food!\n",
      "The place is beautiful, the food is not bad although it is nothing to write home about but it is well priced\n",
      "The excellent treatment. Good food and abundant sets\n",
      "Excellent service, polite, attentive, fast. The Tagliatella of the Montserrat shopping center (Abrera) could learn from them\n",
      "Excellent pizza! Exceptional tagliatelle carbonara; welcoming staff. Perfect\n",
      "All perfect. On the terrace very well\n",
      "Good restaurant. Too bad that the day I went, it was very windy and cold on the terrace.\n",
      "Highly recommended place, 100x100, quality and service.\n",
      "Nice and quiet environment. I went at noon with a friend we felt well cared for and the food, good value for money. Before the Covid I was with my partner and it was exactly the same feeling.\n",
      "Lovely restaurant Super cool superfine pizzas. Very efficient staff, some work like bullets\n",
      "Good food. Excellent treatment\n",
      "To be honest, usually, it had always been good, but yesterday not only the waitress who served us was super edge but also the dishes were dirty ... üò≥ (A glass was so dirty that she noticed herself and changed it directly)Anyway, we will not return.\n",
      "Insufficient amount of food with respect to the price. More and more there is no menu for celiacs.Despite that, good service and attentive and polite waiters! Desserts that look good await us\n",
      "Despite the very good service and good food the prices were a bit high\n",
      "Very good, everything very rich.\n",
      "A super nice atmosphere, very good customer service, adequate variety of Italian dishes, I have liked almost everything I have tried, except the pasta stuffed with pear and gorgonzola that does not taste like anything. I recommend the steaks and pizzas. Prices between ‚Ç¨ 15 and ‚Ç¨ 20 each dish.\n",
      "It is super good, it is very comfortable, the food is delicious and the service is very friendly\n",
      "The food is good, the price could be improved.\n",
      "I had mistakenly posted a disastrous review and I must apologize for that.The truth is that I go sometimes and eat well. Care is good\n",

      "Very good attention from the staff. The food is very tasty and the portions are generous.\n",
      "Good food and exceptional service!\n",
      "Very good terrace, good service. Weekdays a la carte clearly expensive for what is offered since there is no menu, although abundant portions to share with ease. Very rich tagliatella bread.\n",
      "Good pizzas and treated friendly\n",
      "Very well\n",
      "The prudent wait time. Service good but could be better. I really liked my lasagna and carpaccio. The really beautiful and unbeatable atmosphere. I would definitely go back\n",

      "Tagliatella chain restaurant with good customer service and fantastic views of Calle Balmes and Paseo de la Bonanova (we went at 2:00 p.m. and luckily it was free). It has access adapted for the disabled and baby carriages except for sinks that are upstairs. Very good food and very attentive and professional waiters.\n",

      "They brought us cold pizzas. We asked that they be reheated for us while we ate the salad and when we finished the salad the pizzas were still cold.It took more than 45 minutes to bring the dishes. In total, more than an hour and a half to eat two pizzas and a salad.We found the service very fair.\n",

      "Classy restaurant. Waiters available to let you understand the menu because it is not available in Italian. Prices consistent with what the good wine list offers. Good experience.\n",
      "I find it very pleasant here. The prices reasonable. The food was great. Service very friendly and courteous.\n",
      "Very nice view and nice restaurant. The toilets are not considered to be in the basement. The staff are friendly and helpful\n",
      "A delight, the service is at the top, the dishes are homemade in a very kitsch setting with background music. This in the room in the basement because of a storm during the service.Thank you to the entire restaurant team for their kindness.\n",
      "SpectacularVery attentive and pleasant service, good drinks.Adequate price qualityCozy place, super romantic at night, very beautiful.Beautiful day.We will definitely be back!\n",
      "One of the terraces that has become fashionable in Barcelona lately. The sea views are better than the opposite ones. You can grab something and eat some Asian cuisine at a reasonable price. The girl at the front desk and the Colombian waiter who attended to us from ten. Happy Birthday!\n",
      "Incredible service from Nelson the bartender, great cocktails and very yummy cuisine\n",
      "Very good option for a drink. Excellent views and good service.\n",
      "Excellent terrace, top top\n",
      "Super good and the view is fantastic. Perfect for a romantic drink.\n",
      "It depends on the table they give you, the views are not beautiful at all. I insisted when I booked a week before that they give us a good table but it couldn't be. They wanted the whole group to have dinner \"in line\" sitting on a sofa and when we asked for a solution they were quick and friendly. Very good food and quality / price ratio, too. Very good cocktails at a terrace price in Bcn. The kind and friendly service\n",
      "Tasty snacks, nice view\n",
      "Selection of both menu and free buffet, drinks, and desserts in general, apart, good cuisine, and quality product. Place with a certain charm, and Japanese details, that will not leave you indifferent. Customer service, somewhat sober, but correct. üßêüòâüëçüèª\n",
      "It's good, although I don't understand why they spice up so many dishes, if it's already good in itself.I did not like the sauce for the gyozas, and the soy they bring is pre-manufactured.Very fast service, but no friendliness.If it weren't for the spiciness in so many dishes, I would go back, but I'm not going back\n",
      "It's fine, it's not the best I've been, the sushi could be improved just like the fried ones.The place is a bit small and the toilet (even though I don't use it, but a friend does) is super small.Price somewhat expensive for the quality that it is.\n",
      "Good sushi at a good price, at night and on weekends it is a bit more expensive, but if you order buffet you can eat as much as you want.\n",
      "Magnificent quality in relation to price. It has an open buffet for 17 euros on the weekend and everything is delicious. Great variety. Fast and very effective attention. But somewhat dry in the deal. Well ventilated and correct cleaning.\n",
      "Impressive, all very rich. ‚Ç¨ 16 per person without limit. I recommend visiting.\n",
      "A more than correct restaurant for the price (16.5 night menu plus drink separately). There is a lot of variety of starters and then sushi and it was very tasty. I recommend the flamed salmon, the best on the menu! The attention was very good and the dishes arrived very quickly.\n",
      "The food is not fresh and eating raw fish that is not fresh is not very advisable, it takes less than 2 minutes to bring you everything you have ordered and that is because they have everything done and not stored in the refrigerator because it comes at room temperature That is why, as you can see in the photo, comes the dried fish. We will not be back.\n",
      "It is a very nice Japanese restaurant, the menu is open buffet and the night and weekend price is ‚Ç¨ 16.95, the lunchtime menu ‚Ç¨ 11.95 now drinks separately, the dishes are very good, in addition to having a large assortment Japanese dishes also have a wide assortment of national dishes such as chopped entrecote, grilled salmon, grilled shrimp, chicken with almonds, grilled cuttlefish, scallops, etc. So if you are hungry for sushi or other Japanese dishes you can vary a little more.I only put 4 stars because the only defect I see is that the dishes are very scarce and have nothing to do with the photos on the menu, but being an open buffet you can order as much as you want and repeat the dishes.Also, for those who like wine sangria, I recommend 100 x 100, it is very good.\n",
      "We love. We have been there many times and we do not get tired. The attention is perfect and very good value for money\n",
      "Japanese restaurant with good and quality food. They have a free buffet menu of around ‚Ç¨ 16, with drinks and desserts aside. We will repeat, it is not easy to park unless you go by motorbike.\n",
      "cozy place. Quality and quantity of dishes offered excellent. Very attentive staff. Fast service. Possibility of eating all u can.\n",
      "The quality of the product has changed a lot, but for the worse. Super dry and almost inedible chicken with almonds and a frozen tiramisu inside that I have not been able to eat either. Nothing satisfied.\n",
      "The food is alright. No more than that.If you don't understand male staff well and call female staff, feed is good.\n",
      "Pretty fast service and good value sushi.\n",
      "Everything's fine. Very correct and calmto go with friends. Good food atbuff√© style.\n",
      "Quick to serve, good atmosphere\n",
      "Free buffet with a menu at a good price and correct service. As in almost all buffets, if you order a lot, sometimes they don't bring everything you ask for. Recommended for specific occasions\n",
      "Good food. He is a Japanese man brought by the Chinese. One of the Chinese waiters speaks Catalan. Very fast service.\n",
      "The. Best Japanese restaurant in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãlook what I have visited and this one has a gastronomy and cuisine of high altitude. 100% recommendable\n",
      "Very varied sushi buffet. You pay a closed price and you can ask as many times as you want. Quality price highly recommended I have been many times and everything is always very rich. I advise going early, since then it fills up and on some occasions the service is a little slower when they are full. But in summary it is worth going!\n",
      "Very good quality-price sushi in Barcelona. It is always full, also on weekdays, so reservations are recommended. The best, the flamb√©ed salmon nigiris!\n",
      "Good food with a lot of variety, the service is fast and correct. The free buffet is great. Recommended 100%\n",
      "Good price, but the product has dropped in quality.\n",
      "The service very unpleasant. Otherwise, everything in order. Good place to get on top of sushi and the next day visit repeatedly to mr. Rock.\n",
      "Beware: the creativity of the offer outside the typical Japanese buffet restaurant is not worth more on the plate than on paper. The expectations you generate when ordering, in my opinion, do not deliver what they promise. I would go back, but to keep ordering the same old thing in the end as anywhere else: niguis sake, maguro, ebi, unagi / shashimi ... traditional california ... miso, yakisoba / ud√≥n, etc.\n",
      "Very good value for money Free buffet a la carte with lots of variety, you couldn't ask for more for the price.\n",
      "Very good, varied, fast service and an excellent price.\n",
      "One of the best Japanese buffet a la carte restaurants that I have been, very attentive and good treatment.\n",
      "Japanese cuisine with a large dining room where you can order whatever you want and how much you want. The gyozas, the prawns with almonds all great. A highlight is the Leon Maki.\n",
      "Very rich food üòã, without a doubt a good experienceüòå.\n",
      "Very good variety of products. Very friendly and help you choose Japanese food. The quality and price are very consistent\n",
      "Great everything, a lot of variety of dishes, the food very good and the attention too\n",
      "Very good free buffet restaurant in a very good area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBarcelona. Good price quality and easy parking around. A good option to go with family or friends. They have a great variety on the menu.\n",
      "To begin with, the waiters do not even address you at the time of taking orders, they directly write down the numbers and leave. In particular, the waitress who had been assigned to us did not speak the language at all, did not understand that she was asking for bread (a plate that contains the buffet) and to top it all, every time we were going to ask for more dishes she would turn around as a gesture of not wanting to attend. . The dishes were not the ones that appeared on the menu, they have different sauces and it has nothing to do with how they paint it for you. Not only that, but you order a plate of 8u and they bring you one of 4u. In short, a real disaster. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT\n",
      "Neither good nor bad ... we have tried better and worse, let's say it is good and the price Buffet half a day is right. We were annoyed that they did not tell us to close the kitchen and we still wanted to ask for more. They should have told him to ask for everything in time. Good variety in all kinds of dishes, in the susho5 a little repetitive ingredients. Good portions, good quality.\n",
      "Very rich everything\n",
      "If you want to eat a lot for a good price, go ahead. But if you want to enjoy good sushi, it is not the best place. Rice is a paste, and the sauces that cover the dishes cloud the flavor of the dish. The tempura was delicious.\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised.I honestly thought that, for the buffet price, the quality would be quite normal ... and quite the opposite: good quality in relation to the price.They also have a menu with an economical price.If you go at noon and during the week, you will still have to wait a bit although they have a lot of movement.The waiters are very fast with what I simply loved.I'll be back for sure\n",
      "The prawns are great and they have very very varied sushi, I love this place, I always go\n",
      "Rich Japanese food and very cheap and delicious\n",
      "Well prepared Japanese food buffet. Recommended\n",
      "Always perfect!\n",
      "All great. Very quick to serve. Great service.\n",
      "Good quality !Very reasonable price\n",
      "All spectacular üëå, to repeat without a doubt !!.\n",
      "Great food and atmosphere. Ideal to go in a group.\n",
      "The food is very good and the staff is very nice\n",
      "Both the lunch menu and the open buffet have a great variety and everything is very good in relation to quality / price.\n",
      "The lunch buffet is very cheap. The food is very good and variated.\n",
      "Very good quality / price ratio.Quick service and friendly treatment.The premises should be improved.\n",
      "Local nice and clean. The service by the waiters is very agile and attentive. Good variety of dishes although they are not very tasty. The sushi rice is very bland and you have to use a lot of sauce to make it taste good.\n",
      "Delicious!!! The best Japanese food restaurant I have tried so far !!! I will return without a doubt, all very friendly.\n",
      "If you like good food and you like sushi, this is your place. SEN-ZI-LLA-MIND spectacular. You notice the fresh produce and the good hand of the chefs, who by the way can always see how they cook the food. An essential buffet of BCN with a very reasonable price. As a point to improve the dessert.\n",
      "Japanese restaurant quality price very correct. For ‚Ç¨ 10 or so you have four dishes to choose from. Sushi, noodles, rice, miso soup and much more. Simple decoration but very friendly service. They are very fast and pleasant. The children liked everything. There is no changer\n",
      "Good Japanese located in the neighborhood of Sarri√†. To locate in this place is nothing expensive. The free Buffett is 16.50 euros (drink and dessert separately) and is Buffett a la carte.In my opinion, the weak point of the restaurant are the sushis, sashimis, uramakis ... they are fine, but the rice is dismantled by dipping it with the soy sauce, they do not eat well.The rest of the dishes are very tasty.\n",
      "The shushi is good, but since they have changed the name and it is not the LURI we don't like it so much anymore. Anyway we have it as an option!\n",
      "A Japanese food buffet restaurant at a good price and good quality. They are very quick to serve. They have a card with numbers and you choose as many as you want. At night there is a cost of ‚Ç¨ 15.95 drinks separately.\n",
      "They serve fast, a variety of dishes to choose from. Good value for money at the buffet.\n",
      "Quality, good price and good service\n",
      "One of the best Japs that I have been to Barcelona. That I do recommend booking, I went on a Saturday night without a reservation and they had no place. I recommend the buffet on the weekends. They have a very wide menu and you can order as many times as you want, they have no limitation as in other Japs who seem to be in fashion. The quality of the food is very good, you can tell that the rice is fresh, the noodles tasty etc. The good thing is also that the amounts of the makis and uramakis are 2 or 4, that's fine in case 2 people go and want to try several flavors, since in some Japanese they put 8 in each order. They are very quick to serve, to which you do not realize you already have a table full of food, I would recommend ordering little by little so as not to get tied up. The waiters very attentive and the place clean and pleasant. When there are a lot of people, the volume of the room feels a bit high, but otherwise pleasant. I recommend you give it a try if you are a Japanese lover.\n",
      "Everything very rich and well presented! They are attentive and friendly!\n",
      "Very good, abundant food and value for money.\n",
      "Seafood tapas .. Reasonable prices\n",
      "Good site and fast\n",
      "Good a la carte buffet.The offer is full of mainly Japanese dishes and there are also Chinese.There is always room.\n",
      "The delicious buffet. In group, (4), it allows you to try everything. They don't book a table, so you'll probably have to wait. Very light desserts.\n",
      "It was my first time going to a Japanese and I really liked it.There are 4 groups of dishes and you have to choose 4 of the groups you want.Very good food and very affordable price: ‚Ç¨ 11\n",
      "Been here for lunch, didn't like the place. In sushi, the most important thing is good rice and here it was so-so.\n",
      "They have changed their names and I imagine that of owners since nothing to do with before.The bland sushi, the sushis that come with sauce with an excessive sauce flavor (I suppose to cover the bad quality), and it is a buffet but they bring you a little what they want.\n",
      "Japanese who has lost punch. One of the dishes came with a sauce similar to petisuis that I did not like at all but to taste the colors ... From the photo to the presentation there was a difference.\n",
      "Pretty good. Fast service and variety of dishes\n",
      "Fantastic. Speed ‚Äã‚Äãwhen serving, and a great deal. Very rich and quality food.\n",
      "It seems like a quiet place to me, quite crowded at 2:00 pm. Where for 12 euros you can enjoy 4 hot dishes, drink and dessert. The quality of the food is good in relation to the price, I would go again or take it into account if I was very hungry.\n",
      "Good price, both on the menu during the week and on nights and holidays. The very correct quality for the price. I recommend the gyozas, aubergines, tempura chicken and chicken with bamboo.\n",
      "The best sushi buffet without a doubt\n",
      "The employees are not very empathetic when it comes to setting up the tables. I have kindly asked if we could move a table so that my friend would not eat alone and they have totally opposed without any remorse. They leave much to be desired and the chicken is rat meat\n",
      "If you are in the Tres Torres area and want to eat sushi buffet with a menu, to understand all you can eat, this is a good place. Value for money, respected enough.Reviewed on 04/01/2020:If you want to eat here twice in a row you must book or pray to some saint. Once in 11 days that I was a stone's throw from the restaurant I managed to eat. So even if you go the first time, try to book first. It's unlikely they'll give you a table for 2, let alone more.Note:If you come in and see people waiting, don't queue up, go talk to the guy at the cash desk right away, because maybe he'll consider you and get the job straight away.\n",
      "One of the best I have tried in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãgood and fast service, more than reasonable price\n",
      "Open buffet a la carte nothing special. The food is correct. The weekend price is 17 euros but does not include drinks, dessert or coffee. It is convenient to reserve. It does not have a terrace. The service quite fast.\n",
      "Very good menu and atmosphere. 100% recommended\n",
      "I recognize that it is one of the best Sushi Buffet restaurants I have ever tried. Very tasty food, very generous portions and a great variety of sushi, they have recently changed the menu. The treatment with the staff is very good and they take nothing to serve. A place for sushi lovers, highly recommended.\n",
      "Good quantities and price. The menus are very good and a great variety of dishes. Her name is no longer luri\n",
      "Very rich. Good atmosphere.\n",
      "The meals are very rich and cheap prices with good service. EVERYTHING EXCELLENT !!!\n",
      "Great everything and super friendly and kind I recommend it 100%\n",
      "A Japanese buffet with very good quality of food, I was surprised by the quality of the rice. For lovers of makis, sushis etc, who are looking for a great variety, I would not recommend it, since the ones they have are rather the basics, but they do stand out in the variety of other dishes, noodles, gyozas, which are past by the plate and they are delicious. I highly recommend it, I have been several times and will return. I recommend that you book or go before rush hour as it gets very crowded.\n",
      "The best sushi buffet without a doubt!\n",
      "Very good place, we have eaten very well and the service is fast\n",
      "Very nice and suggestive place in vintage style, undoubtedly very nice in aesthetics.Room staff a little inattentive and uninformed, which does not meet the customer's needs very much.Gluten free menu, embarrassing to say the least, even though it passes itself off as gluten free on pasta and pizza.2 varieties of pizza and 2 varieties of gluten-free pasta, to which it is not even possible to add or remove ingredients without a valid reason except \"this is the policy of the restaurant\".Normal pizza overall pleasant, but very different from Italian pizza.I give 3 stars because the location and the pizza were pleasant, the rest quite disconcerting.\n",
      "16eur per plate but they are filling and they serve you quickly.\n",
      "Very attentive and the pizza is delicious üçï \n",
      "Very good service, very attentive but part of the food quite improvable. The good pizza, the pasta and its sauce, very bad, as if taking advantage of a dish from seven days ago. We returned it and understood it perfectly.\n",
      "Horror of gluten-free dishes, very bad service (the waiter didn't even know how to explain that they were carrying the dishes) and the horrible quality. This gluten-free pasta dish (recommended by the cmarero) seemed to be made by my cousin from Belgium with pasta from the mercadona, and even the one from the mercadona seems better.\n",
      "Lunch in full sun in July is one of the worst moves you can make. Talking to the waiter, they know perfectly well that at the table they have given us the direct sun is shining from 2pm to 4pm. No alternative. For me, cross and scratch.\n",
      "We have always liked the Tagliatella pizza, it has not changed in many years. The last two times, the treatment is very friendly.\n",
      "Very good waiter service and very good food. Here they have dishes where no other Tagliatella have them.\n",
      "Very good service. Very friendly waiter and very good food. Presentation of the dishes very aesthetic and appetizing. One of the best Italians I've been to, it's worth going back! The calzone was spectacular\n",
      "Excellent. Great attention from the waiters and exquisite food.\n",
      "Lack of staff.The food was fine, it came quickly.\n",
      "We just finished dinner and the truth is the best of all the attention from the waiter, a very attentive and very nice person, we had pizza and risotto, the pizza was especially delicious. The place is highly recommended\n",
      "Food La Tgliatella. No complains. Service slow and inattentive to the pace of food. Very hot inside the living room. They changed our place and waiter ... we gained in temperature but we lost in quality of service. If you go with children it is a good option.\n",
      "Correct quality / price. Attentive and professional service.\n",
      "Good restaurant, they serve you quickly, they are efficient and the menu is very good.\n",
      "Good attention, good food but the raw material was not fresh, it is still quite good.\n",
      "Nothing out of the ordinary. It had never been and the only thing that is, a chain.\n",
      "Very friendly and up-to-date service.Large portions (how is it to be expected!) And delicious. When ordering an extra on my pasta, there was no problem.Despite being a Saturday night, the atmosphere was not charged and you could talk very well.\n",
      "Spectacular !!!! ‚ô• Ô∏è\n",
      "There is not much to say ... beautiful place, pleasant treatment, and simply great, great\n",
      "Excellent service and food. The four cheese sauce is very good. I have tried the Tuscan calzone for the first time and I must say that I loved it\n",
      "Good quality food at affordable prices and generous servings. Great deal. The terrace service may be a bit slow but it may be due to the dates and the volume of clientele. Without a doubt, a place worth repeating\n",
      "Delicious pizzas, very friendly staff, totally recommended.\n",
      "Always m, still Tagliatella pastaü§©\n",
      "Unfriendly service. They lack organization.\n",
      "Few menu for celiacs\n",
      "Very good service, at all times were pedens, the product very good, is a place to recommend, the right price\n",
      "Good service and food made with consistency. It never fails. You pay for it though. The portions are large.\n",
      "Covid measures are not met. We had to leave, seeing that the cook is not wearing a mask.\n",
      "Everything is good and it is a site and it is also quite reliable as a chain. I recommend the rigatone with vongole summer sauce. The best thing about this site is that you can customize the food a lot. It is a good idea to take a paste between two because they are very large. Desserts are also great. The chocolate tutto disappeared.\n",
      "When you annihilate the quality of a good product with a lousy service from whom you should set the example:The pastas and the pizzas are of good quality, the attention of the waiters is cordial, it hurts the attention of the manager who abruptly gave us the 30 people who were in the restaurant at 0:00 a.m. I went to tell him that he could have said it in a more cordial way and I am not interested, moreover, I raise the bet and I answer that quite a bit that we left until 0:00 when they close at 23:30 (as if one knew what time does the store close) and that's how we do it here, as if saying you don't like it, don't come back. The strange thing is that with the table next to us that there were about 15 people we looked at each other and said ‚Äúwhat ways to say‚Äú we are already closed, please‚Ä¶ ‚ÄùI need to say the word, go away, everything else I had said . Obviously, this Argentinian from Cordoba not only did not mind being more cordial but said he did us a favor. I do not come back, there are a thousand options near equal or better! Bye Bye!\n",
      "Take away pizzas have nothing to do with those eaten in the restaurant ... what a disappointment! Much better to reserve a table and enjoy the delicious pizzas\n",
      "Pizzeria set in an Italian atmosphere. Quality product and correct price (it is Avda. Diagonal). Advisable to ask for reservation.\n",
      "Nothing to object to the quality of the food, correct service, reasonable prices.Now what is totally intolerable is the discomfort we suffered last night. Attached photos.Not even in the worst tavern in Barcelona are you so uncomfortable at the table. To take advantage of the space we had the next table to play ours.Nothing would happen if it did not serve as a corridor, both for customers and waiters.They were continually passing through the narrow space between the tables.With their body (lower area) they invaded our space and dishes ...Gentlemen of Tagliatella, not everything is allowed for wanting to place a few more tables. There is no right!The worst experience in many years.\n",
      "The calzone closed with the raw egg to be baked in the oven. Very very good.\n",
      "Very good terrace and very friendly and attentive waiters\n",
      "Great serviceExcellent food\n",
      "Of the best tagliatella we have tried, both for cooking and for attention, as for tranquility. The pizzas were great, the waitress who served us was very professional and friendly from the beginning and above, they sat us at a very cozy table. We were very comfortable. We love this tagliatella!\n",
      "Excellent very fine pizza\n",
      "We ate pizza. LOVELY!\n",
      "Excellent pasta and good quantity\n",
      "Excellent pasta, risotto above all praise, pizza \"7 cheeses\" was seen for the first time in my life. The portions are large)\n",
      "Good place to eat in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDiagonal (metro) of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbecause it is about 10 minutes. The pizzas and the pasta are very good, but if you prefer to stay full, use the first option, since the pizzas can even be ordered half-heartedly with another person, how big they are.Tip: Depending on the type of pasta the ration is higher, that is, there is more. If you order stuffed pasta the proportion will be less than if you order regular pasta such as spaghetti. Also note that if you are a group of friends who share food with each other, or you pay for things in common (such as bread), you have to pay for what and how you distribute it because we went once and were almost cheated by ‚Ç¨ 19 for a pizza and other things that we had not asked for.\n",
      "For a chain, it's not bad at all. Despite being known for their pizzas, it is worth exploring other dishes that can be surprising (antipasti, above all). They are usually fast and efficient and there is always one nearby. They offer reliability and there are usually no unpleasant surprises, yes, known one, known all.\n",
      "Italian restaurant very good. Follow the line of the other restaurants in the chain.\n",
      "They are very nice\n",
      "Good attention and quality of food\n",
      "I rate negative because despite serving a delicious meal with reasonable portions, we waited more than half an hour (with prior reservation) to be seated and take the order; When they finally arrived, we waited more than 15 minutes just for the drinks ... the few staff who were there did what they could, although in the end I noticed that someone had come out of the kitchen to take orders and serve some tables. The purpose of my rating is that they take into account and solve the personnel issue since apart from the food, the diners always look for a good and diligent service.Nothing to say about the food, exquisite as always.\n",
      "We have been several times and it never disappoints, although the pasta dishes we never finished them, they are exaggerated in quantity.\n",
      "Acceptable food, without major change in your menu. We went at lunchtime (2:00 p.m.) and the attention left a lot to be desired, the restaurant was practically empty and we had the feeling that they were pressuring us to finish.\n",
      "Quality very good price. Large amount of food. If you go as a couple, better share a plate. Great variety of rice dishes, pastas, pizzas and good and original salads.\n",
      "Very expensive for what they give. There are better and cheaper pizzerias. The staff very well\n",
      "Good service and quality of food.\n",
      "Delicious fine pizza, always a good choice\n",
      "Correct attention. They never make you wait too long. Huge, thin and crispy pizzas. The pasta is always abundant and delicious. The bread of the house, indispensable. And the desserts, despite being somewhat expensive, are exquisite.PS: I never remember taking a picture of pizza, I finished it before I knew it !!!\n",
      "Very cute place to eat Italian food. Good variety of both Pastas and Pizzas. Very good service. Unfortunately they brought us lukewarm food. Half price.\n",
      "All right!\n",
      "Excellent food and attention I am a very continuous client of this chain of Restaurants, but recommendation This type of BURNED Bread is not served at the table since they charge it to the client they do not give it away you have to have a little more care in these details\n",
      "Very good service and food good value for money. I really liked the meat lasagna. Exquisite, the pizzas are too thin, but rich. Children's option that could be improved if they added a drink and dessert included.\n",
      "Yesterday, March 27, the restaurant was 90% full with no distance between tables, after indicating my complaint he replied that the website for reservations had not worked.There is no right that they do not control the capacity, they only think of making cash without thinking about the people. I took photos to demonstrate it.It is a shame, having to leave a restaurant because you feel insecure because they do not respect security measures.\n",
      "The usual place to eat a great plate of pasta always al dente\n",
      "Too rich, the excellent food, the antecedent\n",
      "Impressive, variety of products, fresh salads and pizzas, very good service ...\n",

      "Excellent service and delicious salad (goat cheese) and pizza, I recommend the eggplant and honey\n",
      "This restaurant belonging to a chain specialized in Italian food, is within its style, very correct, generous portions, well presented and good service.\n",
      "Good quality in their food, nice place to eat pizza or pasta\n",
      "Good Italian food and very generous portions. Friendly and attentive staff.My rating: 8/10\n",
      "Price somewhat high but very abundant and good taste.\n",
      "Fast service. Pleasant atmosphere. Affable treatment Privacy.\n",
      "They brought us tortellini instead of tortellone caprese and I had to keep it so as not to look bad. The waiter was wrong. The rest ok.\n",
      "Whenever I go there, I go out delighted. Last time I ordered a salad with duck ham and a mousse which was delicious!\n",
      "Excellent pasta and lovely decoration\n",
      "More portions than quality for my liking, though not bad. It‚Äôs good but leaves a lot to be desired for an Italian restaurant. For me it is a last resort when everything fails.\n",
      "Very good pizza\n",
      "All good but it seems that it depends on whether you ask for a shared or individual dish they put more or less quantity on the plate with the same price.\n",
      "A great place to have pasta !! Delicious pesto pasta and spicy pepperoni pizza!\n",
      "Very good food and service\n",
      "Nice Italian restaurant! We went to eat pasta and drink something nice. The order was not very big. Two pastes and sangria. The choice of pasta is large, and ravioli are also present in them. You can also add a sauce of your choice to them. There are also options already assembled separately. We ordered spaghetti + ala norma and ribbons with pesto sausages and pine nuts. There is a lot of pasta and those who eat little can eat two from one portion. Very tasty! Also, the waiter brings separately grated cheese for sprinkling. I advise everyone who loves aperol spritz to try sangria on prosecco. A very interesting combination. There were also compliments from the establishment in the form of olives, oil and different types of focaccia. All in all a good place for an evening!\n",
      "Better impossible. We ate on a Saturday lunchtime after having been in the Montjuic area and everything was perfect. Both the location, on the top floor of CC Las Arenas with very good views from the table where we were placed, as well as the quality of the food (special mention for the pepperoni pizza and desserts) and the service. We have been to several restaurants in this chain and this one is definitely among the best.\n",
      "You eat well !!! As in all or almost all the restaurants of this franchise. The pasta dishes are quite abundant so if you want pasta and pizza I recommend that one of the 2 dishes be shared unless you are quite gluttonous. The service for my taste quite weak. Quite correct quality-price ratio. The place is very good. For me the best are the great views of Barcelona that you can enjoy if you eat on the terrace.\n",
      "The worst pizza I've ever eaten in my life. It shouldn't even be called pizza. The dough does not exist. It is a sheet of bread with tomato thrown in, it all crumbled. I think the one that Pakistanis sell frozen is much better. Having said that, it is a nice place that is very touristic.\n",
      "A varied menu and for all tastes. They put very complete dishes and it is impossible to have a first and a second, you can ask for a first to share. Good quality and well prepared. How you stick something expensive and the tables very close together for the times of the Covid.\n",
      "Terrible attention, they treat you as if they were going to give you the food and not pay for it, especially the Italian blonde girl (the waitress or manager) takes an hour to attend, an hour to bring the food, they give you a menu that does not even have the prices (quite expensive by the way) the food we ordered pizza and it did not taste like anything super bland I ordered a sirloin and you have to eat it as they want, they do not give you the option to change anything or even the sauce, the garnish a salad of pure lettuce with nothing As a dressing, the Italian girl who attends you asks me as if she were going to give you the food without the slightest courtesy or empathy with the customer, what term did she want the meat? I told him well done and after waiting an hour and my hunger had already stopped, they brought it raw, I had put the sauce that was on top of the meat and when they took it they brought it to me cut in half like a flip-flop and dry without sauce, or I bothered to ask for sauce again because I should have stayed to sleep there until they brought it to me, in short a disaster bad attention expensive food that even the price is not put on the menu to force you to pay what they want after that have eaten, tasteless flavor in a pizza the easiest in the world a good sauce the base of a good pizza, the only good thing to highlight that is why I give it two stars was the attention of a blond boy with an Argentine or Uruguayan accent super friendly and courteous and the pasta portions that were not bad in taste although I have eaten them much better and for an Italian restaurant they serve a decent amount since most serve minimal portions, in summary I do not recommend it, you can eat half with exce lent attention and better food in many Italian restaurants\n",
      "The typical chain restaurant. Good food at a reasonable price. The exquisite treatment.\n",
      "don't miss the foie pizza\n",
      "Because I can‚Äôt put 0, I‚Äôm from the neighborhood due to the Pandemic a long time ago we‚Äôre not going. The pasta was hard we left it I did not eat second course, we were asked twice how it was, the answer was that the pasta was hard, we were asked a third and we are still waiting for a manager to come, they are like robots ask and answer follow a script. It is clear that we will not return to Las Arenas and it is a pity not to be able to make a neighborhood.\n",
      "Horrible experience, I have lost some patatas bravas, which was simply fried potatoes with no more sauce of any kind at ‚Ç¨ 7, /. A total scam\n",
      "Negative experience.Although I'm a fan of La Tagliatella, I didn't like it at all. (2 hours for lunch, little service)2 pizzas (one half stuffed and burnt), a salad, 2 pasta dishes, a glass of wine, 2 waters, 2 zero alcohol and 4 desserts, 112 ‚Ç¨ (without coffees)!We won't be able to move from home soon!\n",
      "I ordered a margarita pizza and asked if it would not be too big for one person, to which the waitress replied very kindly, not the waitress. Then it didn't turn out to be like that and I had to leave half a pizza uneaten, because the dough was also too thick.\n",
      "The pizzas are very good.\n",
      "I really liked it, but the pasta dish seemed very big. I highly recommend it !!!!\n",
      "Very good, calm and quite fast\n",
      "Ideal for where it is and for the waitress.I almost ran out of reservation ... they did NOT sign it up!The rest ... could get more out of it!\n",
      "Pretty well done Italian food. It is a chain of restaurants that usually has a good reputation, sometimes you can get a good place, sometimes not, but in this case the food was of the day and it was very good.The value for money is very good and the portions are generous. The place is very neat, clean and is in a very good location on the roof of the Las Arenas shopping center. The service has been very attentive, polite and willing.The dark-haired, curly-haired boy who served us on Sunday May 16 lunchtime shift, has been very kind, and although it was not his fault, he has apologized several times for not having a table available while we expected.\n",
      "Good views, exquisite attention, good food and reasonable price. Delighted to have eaten there, if I go back to Las Arenas I will repeat for sure .. the only downside, we could not book by tf and we had to queue at the entrance, it was fast but I did not like that because of the crowding at the entrance.\n",
      "Very good. High prices but adequate for the quantity of rations and their quality.The attention of the waiters is good and maybe if I had to put a ‚Äòbut‚Äô it would be the interior lighting. It depends on which areas are too dark and difficult to read the letter, for example.\n",
      "The restaurant is very nice and the food was very good, but the problem was the attention, it took almost 45 minutes to deliver a simple order\n",
      "We ate tonight at the pizzeria. They put the letter on a tablecloth to choose from. Once we choose, they take the paper tablecloth. In the times that we are to whom do those tablecloths return and what worries me the most, who those tablecloths come from. They put a salad to share without services that allow it. Starting the last pizza we ask them for some beers to finish and we finish the pizza and the beers have not appeared. At the end they put the beers without pizza. After a bad gesture they put us some olives that have more bone than meat. Simply disastrous. I do not advise anyone. The salad for the price that is quite scarce and bad. Very short quality pizzas with a broken dough. It is not advisable at all. My assessment is total negative. Very bad.\n",
      "You can't take any pictures because we were very hungry, and the food was very good. And before they took little time to serve us something that is appreciated. It is a meal that you end up full, I mean in the pasta it is a fairly large and full plate. The pizzas are also good, it is thin crust. The desserts are very good, I am a lot of tiramisu, because I had not tried it like that and it was very good because it is rather creamier, not so pastel roll. I recommend it. And the mushroom pasta with very rich truffle.And it is also a beautiful place because you have the views of pl. Spain.Is it worth going? My answer is yes.\n",
      "Excellent location, very friendly service and spectacular views of Barcelona.\n",
      "A little slow with the service and order taking .. But once everything arrived .. It was for the best, all very good value for money, and very generous portions.We will go again.\n",
      "What a pity. We have been to many tagliatellas and the worst service is here, only one waiter is saved. The food luckily good as in the whole chain.\n",
      "Perfect location, you can reach from any public transport. Spectacular view. Very beautiful and pleasant atmosphere. Great service. Traditional Italian cuisine with lots of pasta options. Wine list is limited.\n",
      "Perfect location and can arrive from any public transport. Spectacular view. Very beautiful and pleasant environment. Excellent service.Traditional Italian cuisine with many pasta options. Wine list is limited.\n",
      "I am a critic in restaurants and I have to say that the pasta had dry pieces and blackened pieces, the pizza was cold !! I have gone to other tagliatellas and very good !!Service both in Andorra, Igualada, great tarrega and very good coordination between manager and workers, difference in local arenas-Barcelona ... the organization and time in clients is essential, it would be necessary to improve and thus earn more!\n",
      "A wonderful experience !!! From the attention when entering with Se√±or Danilo, to the waiters and the incredible taste of pasta. A round of applause for the Chef and his entire Team !! I have traveled to My dear ITALY !!! ‚ù§üëèüëèüëè\n",

      "I ordered a carbonara and it certainly wasn't a carbonara, I don't know what that was or who is responsible for that recipe that looks like a Spanish carbonara from 20 years ago. I regretted as soon as I saw the plate, a cooked bacon and a rather suspicious white sauce that I prefer not to say what I think it had. What a shame.\n",
      "Food as always excellent. I have sat where in theory it is part of the terrace and it was all closed and without air, okay, there is no air conditioning, but the windows (which in all the other restaurants were open) here were closed and it was very hot\n",
      "Very cozy place And a lot of quality of the dishes that yes I would reduce the reactions a little. Really well\n",

      "Well. Good views. The menu a bit small ...\n",
      "Eating here does not disappoint, the delicious hot wings, I like this type of food, but enjoying a terrace overlooking the sea, it is the best place to eat KFC that I know. And all at the same price\n",

      "It was not good, the chicken pieces and the potatoes were overheated, at first glance you could see that they were not fresh, well too bad for being located right in front of the central point of all Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbut hey I put a star because I cannot comment without putting 0.\n",

There were several empty tables and many of them were not set up for lunch. It was in one of those that were not mounted on which we sat. Although we told them it was just a coffee and we were leaving there was no way. They did not even tell us that well. A waiter with glasses and gray hair was the one who treated us.

      "At least, there is a waiter, haughty and proud and impolite who has made a mistake by profession and who has not understood that being a waiter is going to attend the tables, not from the bar, being polite and also allowing Luxury when it catches your eye, leaving and leaving you unattended.

      "They had sold me peppers at different times, and the waiter denied me only for not going to ask for cooking.Very badly educated I asked for the sangria in a way and gave it to him as he pleased.I always come to eat here, but only because of the bad education I had today I will not eat again.\n",
      "Expensive for the quality of food they offer. I ordered a coke and they didn't even tell me that it wasn't on the menu and when they saw the bill when I complained they didn't even have the professionalism to apologize. On the other hand, very bad treatment from the brunette waitress who told me in a bad way that they did not exchange dessert for teas or coffees. In the area you have better restaurants. . I WILL NOT COME BACK\n",
      "Excel. Slow value for money, in a place that breathes good taste and good treatment.\n",

The bread: 4 only pieces that were not seen, when I told them that if that was the amount for ‚Ç¨ 3 that we did not want, they brought us a plate full of bread saying that they had been confused. The same with prawns. They brought us the four that were missing. We left without desserts or coffee, not to return. Quite expensive for poor service and attempts to \"cheat\" in quantity, not in quality, but it is good.\n",
      "Great service but not so much food. Most of the products are frozen. Expensive prices for the quality of the food\n",
      "We have been delighted with the welcome, the service and, of course, in the preparation of your meal. We have loved the contrast of flavors and the presentation of their dishes. The place is very cute and the atmosphere very nice. We will definitely be back!\n",

      "Good place to have a drink, a snack or dinner. Good treatment of the staff and willing to help.\n",
      "Not that I don't like it. What seems unfortunate to me is that priority should be given to foreign dinner schedules, and to nationals or neighbors, at 7pm, and even before, we cannot have a coffee or a beer. We must take care of the native market. This is advice from a person who has been in the commercial world for more than 25 years.\n",
      "We went to try the noon menu. It initially cost ‚Ç¨ 16, but for being on the terrace, there was a supplement of ‚Ç¨ 1.5. That is, ‚Ç¨ 17.5 (a half menu cost ‚Ç¨ 12) that included 3 first and 3 seconds, drinks and desserts.Not to mention that it gave you time to do the digestion between plate and dish (neither the terrace nor the interior was full), the food arrived cold on the terrace.In addition, they charged us almost ‚Ç¨ 4 more because soft drinks did not enter the menu (yes wine or beer) and for ordering coffee instead of dessert.In short, a robbery. Correct food but service and price not to repeat.\n",

      "Very endearing place for the people of the neighborhood, but now it's the worst of the worst .... expensive and bad and the attention slow and bad\n",
      "Good attention, terrible menu even with supplements, salty and pasty black rice, fried eggs with serrano ham, when they put Iberian ham (supplement ‚Ç¨ 1.5), cold and low-quality sirloin, accompanied by inedible, saut√©ed and raw vegetables (suppl. 6 ‚Ç¨). In drinks they put a supplement even in soft drinks (‚Ç¨ 0.50), beer a 250 ml. Beer, that desserts take advantage of them because I did not ask for them. I do not recommend it bad experience, if it comes to costs, you would have to press on other things and not affect the customer so powerfully, that for two menus I paid ‚Ç¨ 45.20\n",
      "Modernized traditional bar, opposite the Mercat de St AntoniThe service is very fast and the waitresses are very friendly (something not very common in other nearby terraces)Menu of tapas and dishes. Homemade vermouth\n",
      "It is a place that eats very well, but the waiters' attention often fails.If you are lucky, someone great will take care of you, other times you have to go prepared for terrible attention.But the terrace is very cool. A not very extensive menu but generally good and good desserts.The octopus is great!\n",
      "Good bar where to have a vermouth and some tapas. Unbeatable location, perfect customer service but food could be better gotten in my opinion.\n",
      "Food very good and value for money, super! Elaborated dishes! üëåAnd the very kind attention. I will be back! üëç\n",
      "Excellent situation. Prices a bit high but worth it, very well prepared food. A special mention to the waitress of Filipino origin: good professional, affectionate, kind, funny and pretty. A success for a place like this. He treated us with great kindness and good service, he advised us on tapas, you can't stop eating. This is one of the places in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwhere you really should be.\n",
      "FRIEND IT IS NO LONGER WHAT IT WAS, IT HAS GONE TO WORSE. THE WORST BROKEN EGGS WITH POTATOES IN BARCELONA. THE GOAT CHEESE FLAVOR WAS UNBEATABLE.THE OILS MUST BE CHANGED. TO END:BAD FOOD. ONLY THE SYMPATHY OF THE WAITRESSES IS SAVED ...\n",
      "friendly service, you can sit outside in the shade and watch people live. In front of all guests from the neighborhood and no tourist trap.The Sant Antoni market with its wonderful renovated market hall is directly opposite and well worth a visit.Tables and chairs are disinfected after each visitor, staff wear masks.I always enjoy being here.\n",
      "We went alone for a coffee and we left with a good anger. Literally half an hour to serve us, and when we tell the waitress, she drains the bag, blaming her partner with an unpleasant tone. All professionalism.\n",
      "only three stars, for the price a cane 2.85 or I find expensive, for the rest the very friendly staff and good service, you can already give it with these prices\n",
      "I do not recommend it because of the bad attention they just wanted them to drink, eat us and leave quickly they came to clear the table inviting us to consume more or in a few words to leave I felt that they were kicking us out and I made the family run to leave we will not return it's a shame because the bravas were very tasty\n",
      "Recently remodeled premises. Good dishes to nibble on but a bit pricey.\n",
      "This restaurant is a classic. Formerly it was famous for appetizers with clois√´s.Now it is completely restored, updated and very modern.\n",
      "All very well, Bikiniis great! And very good attention ..\n",
      "The brave ones are worth nothing .... Super bad to pay 5 ‚Ç¨ and peakMaybe other things are better .. I haven't tried them.\n",
      "The food was good but I can't accommodate all the mistakes and disrespect on the part of the two waitresses. Some unpresentable from beginning to end, if I give them a chance again, it is to ask for the claim sheet.\n",
      "Next to the Sant Antoni market. A great place to have a fork breakfast or a bermuda. Very good tapas. Scrambled eggs, potatoes, squid, stew ... And much more. All very good.Oh, if at the tables if you have any problems do not hesitate to ask for Raquel, she will surely solve everything.It's a crack. (Km. 0)\n",

      "Very good food excellent attention\n",
      "The dishes are all very good, the service very attentive and fast. We have been great\n",
      "Fatal ... they have clearly gone from more to less ... I had to ask for the bread three times, continuous distractions and the worst ... I asked for ice in a glass and they charged me ‚Ç¨ 0.15 ... \"ice supplement\"\n",
      "The place is cool, we made the vermouth, the product was good, but the price was inflated. Service pretty poor a lot of waitresses and it took them 10 minutes to bring a bag of potato chips, when the restaurant wasn't even full. So FATAL value for money. A shame\n",

      "Modern bar with elaborated tapas very rich!I do not know why, but I have read many negative comments and the truth is that it is a bar that wants to differentiate itself from the rest, and with its decoration, its menu and its dishes, it manages to be different. I am from the neighborhood and have gone to eat or to drink something several times and the truth is that they have always treated me well!The octopus is a joy, the bravas and the rest of the tapas do not disappoint! The terrace has a privileged location just in front of the Sant Antoni market. It shows that it is a new bar and that it lacks some personality, but I still give it confidence!\n",
      "Restaurant with elaborate decoration, like all those new restaurants near the Mercat de Sant Antoni, you get carried away by the lighting and decoration and a menu of 12 euros that seems to be fine. Normal attention, nothing to write home about. The mediocre food or what follows: pasta carbonara, which turned out to be gnocchi (needless to mention, I'm not a fan), barbecue with puree, all super dry, difficult to eat; and the salad, well, with fresh local produce üòÇü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n"

      "I do not put less stars because it is not possible. For 3 sandwiches, 2 of potato omelette, 1 of bacon with cheese, a bikini, 3 cokes and a beer = 40 euros. It is what has been called a robbery. Later they will complain that with the pandemic they do not make money, but in my opinion that is cheating.\n",

In some cases, when the customer finds a hair in the food, it must be said.2. The first course arrived COLD - I didn't order caspaccio! The waitress, instead of asking for Pardon, had the audacity to tell me 'it's cold!'3. The plate came the second time with a hair inside the food! The chambermaid not only didn't say 'I'm sorry' but again, she had the audacity to say 'but where do you see it?' and took the plate without apologizing.4. The same dish arrived LA TERZERA time and it was so obviously heated in the microwave. At this point my appetite was gone5. It is useless to say that they did not intend to give a brief on the account, or offer something. And it is useless to say, that I have never heard the phrase 'Sorry' or 'Excuse me'.\n",

Sorry for the inconvenience\n",

They ask for drinks and that while we look at the letter that makes some braves, we asked for it. Our surprise was that before we arrived the croquettes and the table (carpaccio) of sausages that covered them, the drink and we did not say about the bravas we are still waiting for them ... they forgot they say. Additionally, they took the drink to my wife when he had half left and said: oysters forgiveness, now I bring you another one, do not worry that this one invites the house, it would only be missing. I do not know if it has been that they have had a bad day, but what if I can assure how we have said there is that we never return. Excess price quality and bad service.\n",

      "A disappointment. A nice and pleasant place that loses everything when you realize that more than 10 minutes have passed and you don't have a beer on your table. The bravas are acceptable despite the small portion that they serve for 4.50, the croquettes are nothing to write home about 1.80 and the worst are the artichokes (armed robbery 2 for 7.60, they have justified the quality of the Italian product; I do not deny it but for that reason price you expect a little more quantity ... 3 or 4, never 2)I have put the star for the beer.\n",

      "We went to drink a group of 12 people on the terrace, and the waitress very kindly invited us to separate tables because it was \"company policy\" without offering any alternative to relocate.

October 18, strike day in Catalonia, the city of Barcelona to burst people coming from all parts of Catalonia, for the demonstration this afternoon. Many closed bars, they DO NOT. Curiously at 3pm there is nothing left of the noon menu. I have to ask for a plate of the letter. I order grilled squid and they didn't have a good smell or color. They had stuck that thing that comes out when they have nothing fresh. Still I have eaten them. They put bread on me, dry. Obviously at another table they did not eat it and they put it to me: ‚Ç¨ 1.20 for the bread. The squid go to know when ‚Ç¨ 17'45. A cane says in the \"import\" record, I say that everything and great trip went from the bar to my table: ‚Ç¨ 3.30. Total I have paid ‚Ç¨ 21'95 and I am absolutely sure that I will not return in life (although I work very close) nor will I speak well of you, ever. This is not how you get clientele. Ah!

I would like to tell the owner of the restaurant to have more respect for the people who are no longer with us, the relatives who have not yet recovered from a loss, those who come to his restaurant trusting that everything is hygienically controlled, because in His restaurant with characters like this working, is not at all sure, that no, we can get it. If supposedly this man for his own health cannot wear a mask, he cannot work with the public, it is a danger for clients. Be aware of my comments, of course I am not going to eat until I see that the \"waiter\" is wearing the protection of the mask, because next time I will denounce him in another way.

      "In a quiet and stately area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe upper part of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãsurrounded by a garden where palm trees are not lacking, Nuba is for me a reference of very good cuisine in a truly unique design framework. This restaurant occupies a unique construction that has 1,200 square meters distributed between its restaurant room and a terrace full of green areas. The project of the interior designer Estrella Salietti, is characterized by a modern and careful decoration, which makes it a diaphanous and sophisticated space. It stands out for its breadth and warmth; Large comfortable leather armchairs and elegant lights are the decorative elements that appropriate aesthetics. The restaurant offers market cuisine, with top quality products and a very successful preparation and a very careful presentation. On our visit we asked the chef to make us a tasting menu to savor the best dishes of the current menu. We have started the meal with an appetizer with some eggplant chips, some tasty Iberian ham croquettes and some special Am√©lie oysters 3. Next, an eggplant carpacciode, goat cheese, cane honey and pine nuts; then, a sea and a mountain, Maresme peas with \"espardenyes\" and then a house star dish, the royal crab with avocado and tomato, a delight; The monkfish continues and finally the beef tenderloin steak with foie po√™l√© and wild asparagus, another delicacy. For dessert, the chocolate souffle. All washed down with an Albari√±o Mas de Frares. Highly recommended.\n",

      "How delicious we ate ... It was a long time ago when I went ... But it was great. We celebrated my mother's birthday and they treated us great!\n",
      "Quality / price is correct. The pasta we ordered with burratina and pistachio pesto was spectacular. The vegetable and shrimp wok too. All this accompanied by a white wine \"Fortunate\" was a success. We had dinner on the terrace and the staff was very attentive. We can't wait to return :)\n",
      "Ajoblanco is always a good option! He had always gone to the restaurant at night. It is well known in Barcelona because it is perfect for dinner and a few drinks, but now due to the pandemic I have visited it during the day and I still love it. It has a special vibe. They also serve a delicious lunch menu at a very good price for the area that it is. Better to always book and more now with the capacity limitations they have ...\n",
      "We went as a group of 8 people to eat the lunch menu. Good food but it is not to go to eat on a work day, as it takes us more than 2 hours on a work day ... Slow service. 1 hour to bring us the seconds, we asked for a water that never arrived. Site not recommended if you are in a hurry ...\n",
      "Friday menu price quality / price very good\n",
      "A very complete executive menu on the smallest street in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãseasoned with good service and a very nice atmosphere. I leave you with the Burrata salad, highly recommended\n",
      "Noon menu in the era of the pandemic. Pleasant atmosphere, decoration between French and from the first 1/4 of the 20th century. Very acceptable menu, we found the food to be very good in every way. Correct service, sometimes a bit confused: I request the bill and they send us to pay at the cashier when other diners brought the pos to the table.\n",
      "A perfect atmosphere, very professional and pleasant staff.\n",
      "They have a very varied menu with many options. The quality is very good. Sometimes they are a hair slow when serving. The rest all very well!\n",
      "ALL VERY RICH\n",
      "Good atmosphere. Two dishes that we ordered were not available.The service was very bad, the first ones arrived together with the starters and they forgot one.\n",
      "A perfect dinner with friends. They prepared a very good group menu for us, then we had a few drinks and great. Highly recommended\n",
      "Bad attention. We went to have a drink and asked for the menu, they indicated that they did not have them, so we decided to order a vodka and a rum. When asked what type of rum he had to offer, they indicated only three types, when at the bar they had another variety of rums to which they offered us.Really very bad attention from the waiters.\n",
      "We liked it a lot, both the food and the treatment. Very adequate price\n",
      "Good food, correct service. We were a 'small' group; 8 people, the restaurant was not very crowded due to the current situation but we were very comfortable and at ease\n",
      "I really like the product, the how Know,And all the show business compensated with high class balance. Greetings from Washington\n",
      "Of shame, and to denounce them. Today I call to make a reservation for lunch on Thursday. The person who answers the phone tells me that they don't understand me, and that they don't have anyone who speaks Catalan to take the reservation. Good wind and new boat guys‚Ä¶ !!\n",
      "201812 A great site, a large space with a very good decoration. Quiet atmosphere. Good and attentive service. I can not speak of prices I have not seen. Good quality in food and a pleasure for the senses.Recommended, I will return to confirm and see prices.\n",
      "Good atmosphere and Gint√≤nics\n",
      "An obvious problem with the cooking, the eggplants that accompanied the pasta were still raw and the potatoes in the main course at best cold, and some still frozen. Server response, \"I'll let the chef know,\" no apologies, no gestures. It seems that it is because there are a lot of people ... this is already not an acceptable reason but we imagine what it will be when the capacity returns to 100% (for the record today it is 30%).\n",
      "It was quite good, good food, good staff .. the only \"but\" .. when they. brought me the. account to pay with a card, I paid.and the account was taken, nor did he let me see the.account . .\n",
      "Chic, well-kept and beautiful restaurant. Classic atmosphere üòä\n",
      "A very nice place, the 20 euro lunch menu is fantastic. Well made and good quality dishes. The wines on the menu are very correct. Very friendly staff.I haven't tried the letter.In the evenings good atmosphere. People 40 and peak. Good music and good drinks. The butt always.\n",
      "We went to eat on a weekday and it took them a long time to bring the meals, in addition to the fact that some of the things we ordered were not brought. Executive lunch lasted 2 hours\n",
      "Food rich and well cooked but scarce. High price for the quantity. It eats rich but you stay hungry. The decoration and atmosphere very cozy and with good taste üëå\n",
      "Good weekly menu, the inside temperature is always very cold\n",
      "Good food, good service and good situation\n",
      "Fatal attention !!! It is NOT worth it, pessimistic staff in terms of how to serve the client, they only serve to chargeü§Æ\n",
      "Beautiful decoration with white and wood with a bar specializes in cocktails until three in the morning. During the day it is quieter and they do Mediterranean and contemporary cuisine. Some tables are too close together and there is no privacy. Very good attention. Prices are around 40 for a meal, but with El Tenedor there is a discount.\n",
      "An amazing place where the first thing you'll be confronted with is a highly professional service and a beautiful design straight from the interior of the Titanic. Elegant service led us to an elegant table, at which we were very professionally served. We drank drinks here, which were literally flavored variations, raspberry - full of raspberry and raspberry flavors. Raspberry, not something that imitates them. I will definitely return there because it is really worth it.\n",
      "Good food\n",
      "Elegant restaurant in the noble business area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBarcelona. Sober decoration, spacious tables and a cozy atmosphere. Well served lunch menu of adequate quality at a very fair price. Attentive and friendly service\n",
      "Varied executive menu. Correct service.\n",
      "Very good food. Menu of the day with a fixed price but some dishes on the menu with an extra price not indicated with the ‚Ç¨ sign, nor does the waiter tell you when you ask. Such a subtlety.\n",
      "Simply excellent, perfect service, great staff involvement, modern and elegant themes and succulent cuisine. 200% recommended and to enjoy also in semi-night hours because the atmosphere that frequents this place is very attractive.\n",
      "Without more ... the place is beautiful. It is good to go to eat in groups but little else. It is perfect to go with friends to dinner and then have a few drinks in the neighborhood because it is located on a street with nightclubs and parties ... but at the level of gastronomy, service, price, etc ... it is very popular. As always, it depends on what you are looking for!\n",
      "Excellent attention! The price-quality concept is fine. When I visit them they didn't have a bartender so the variety of cocktails was very small, however they were very kind to prepare me a margarita. I recommend it to spend an evening with friends since at night for dinner there is live DJ\n",
      "Very nice and cozy restaurant. Good service and good dishes.I edit ... Very few portions compared to other visits asking for the same dishes. Very expensive, especially wines.I edit ... the relationship quality, service and price is not proportional. Excessively expensive for the professionalism of the service and quality of products. Slow and unprofessional service. Lousy steak quality. Squid well. Regular broken eggs, clear unmade. Croquettes very good. Very hard, bad coca bread. The place is fine. Monkfish suquet good. Wines exorbitant prices. General Note 5.\n",
      "It is a lovely place. The decoration is very original, the food is very good and the treatment by the staff is unbeatable. The design of the letter is very original. I will repeat for sure.\n",
      "Restaurant versus cocktail bar. Located in the business area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBarcelona. The atmosphere is elegant and the clientele cosmopolitan. The quality of the dishes and the service is excellent. I would highlight the wide range of cocktails.\n",
      "Good deal\n",
      "Well focused on group dinners, within an economic range\n",
      "Nice and pleasant, although I expected better quality food in a place where the daily menu is somewhat more expensive than the average in the area (almost 15 euros).The churrasco had more fat than meat, im chewy. It looked very good, but when you cut it, you could see that it was poor quality meat (in fact it was hard to cut the meat).The first courses much better than the second ones, without a doubt. The only second that was really very good was the bream.Lentils with squid very good, recommended.The location of the restaurant is good, in calle tuset, without much traffic and with a wide sidewalk, you can eat outside in peace.\n",
      "Very good food, lunch menu. Quality price of 10. Well air conditioned and very nice place. Phew meat. Tremendous\n",
      "Yen discovery, nice place, very good cuisine, good decoration. Your lovely chef\n",
      "Baked rib, \"exquisite\", vegetables with goat cheese, good vegetables Excaso cheese\n",
      "Not bad,\n",
      "Nice, pleasant and quiet place especially on weekdays. The dishes are small with a price much higher than normal, so it is to go every once in a while. They have good fish dishes. Always to snack (about ‚Ç¨ 10/12 per plate). That is, do not go hungry or you will leave some good tickets.\n",
      "Very trendy restaurant in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand rightly so. The service is nice and attentive, and the food in general very rich. Highlight grilled octopus, tuna tartare and sirloin. To put some but, the plate of crashed eggs was a bit scarce, and the lack of a lot of wines from the menu. You can stay with a drink while you dance until 3h, and then stop by the Sutton nightclub that is right in front of you. Highly recommended, although prices are high.\n",
      "Very nice place, good service and excellent food\n",
      "The service was loose and the food was raw.\n",
      "Good atmosphere for dinner, a drink and then dancing\n",
      "Excellent restaurant and cocktail bar. We have gone to eat the menu and everything was exquisite. Great attention from all the staff. We have to repeat at night. We have come from Girona just to try it\n",
      "The waiter is very good and the decoration is very special. This restaurant is very authentic!\n",
      "Correct executive menu, with variety. The correct service too.\n",
      "Site of \"export\", not only for the food, but for the cocktails, in fact, I don't know how people ask for the same old thing (gin and tonic, mojito, whiskey with cola, etc.), having such good cocktail options, especially with Gius (Italian girl) who knows all the cocktails to make you happy, and who is obligatory to ask for an \"Italian song\" ...Visiting site, but above all a cocktail party required by BCN.\n",
      "Freshness, inventiveness. A treat for the taste buds with a DJ from 11 p.m., a treat for the ears\n",
      "Trendy, cozy restaurant with live dj, good music. Warm decor and subdued lighting.We went for a cocktail.‚Ç¨ 12 without alcohol. Strawberry mojito.Attentive and very professional waiter service.\n",
      "I ate menu at an affordable price with good qualityrecommendable\n",
      "The decoration \"sui generis\", that is, with added value; the dishes are very rich, the value for money on the menu is good, but the attention is somewhat distant.\n",
      "The restaurant is fine but the food is relatively expensive in relation to quality. To have a cocktail is fine.\n",
      "Perfect, cozy and exquisite!\n",
      "The right food the local the best but very crowded\n",
      "An unbeatable and luxurious quality-price show\n",
      "super attentive service spectacular food, 100% recommended\n",
      "It is a place where you eat very well\n",
      "Very slow service and they were wrong three times with the drinks. Quality price is not worth it.\n",
      "I will repeat. Like garlic\n",
      "Very, very good quality / price ratio. Despite the difficulties of the Covid era in Catalonia and Barcelona.\n",
      "Well cared for and very tasty food. We have gone to dinner with a discount from the Fork (to try the place) and we will definitely return because both decoration, attention and dishes have been very good. I leave you a photo of some of the things we tried. By the way, the sachets of mushrooms with foie were vice!\n",
      "Food and attention very well,\n",
      "restaurant during the day bar during the night.\n",

      "Good service, very nice and friendly atmosphere, fair price.\n",
      "It's okay to have a drink ... but it's clear that it has a chic level that is a bit selective with the people who enter this site.\n",
      "Bar restaurant very careful in decoration, very elegant, professional cocktails made by great professionals of the mixology, exquisite meals, impeccable service, the negative part is that it is quite expensive.\n",
      "Well enough!\n",
      "The healthy, rich menu with good service\n",
      "A luxury. 24 üëå floor view\n",
      "The tower is unattractive on the outside but the hotel is beautiful on the inside!The decor is luxurious and the staff welcoming and helpful.The rooms are spacious and well appointed.The bedding is very comfortable. The whole is clean and maintained.\n",
      "Service quite curious, tossing up weird. Getting your knees noticed in a 5 * is weird. Very good Omakase menu. The brutal food. The space is beautiful. We wish them a lot of success, even though it is focused on the foreign client, it will cost them to reach the premises, at the prices.\n",
      "Fantastic decoration As appropriate the restaurant is very good. A fabulous view and exquisite food. It is expensive but you cannot expect anything else at this level. Worth it\n",
      "Good food, normal service and what I do not understand is that I ordered wine pairing, and they bring you the glass served without knowing or explaining what wine is. For the price and comparing it to other michelin star sites I find the price overstated\n",
      "Very good views of the city if you arrive when there is still a little light. Very friendly staff though (it will be because they were the first days) quite chaotic and slow service. Very noisy. Correct food, nothing from the other world compared to other restaurants of the style (fusion / Japanese / Peruvian) in Barcelona. The tasting menu is not worth it.\n",
      "We were in the restaurant of the hotel, very nice space with very good views of the city. Fusion cuisine with good quality, maybe a bit longer than originality. Very attentive staff\n",
      "The restaurant is very new in Chinese style, the breakfast on the 23rd floor is rich, and the dining space is wide open, overlooking the Sagrada Familia.\n",
      "The hotel workers are excellent\n",
      "Staff very attentive and polite and lovely rooms and is just opposite the train station Sants. Wonderful hotel.\n",
      "Luxury at an affordable price to eat with the Bento box options\n",
      "Excellent atmosphere, wonderful views of Barcelona. Pleasant music and very good food\n",
      "Although we loved the restaurant and already criticized it, the room and breakfast did not meet the expectations.Very mediocre breakfast with not freshly made pastries, and very little variety, nothing hot at the buffet, the juice was not natural, nothing to do with other hotels in the city.In the room there are no amenities in the bathroom, except for the shower cap. And the blinds button didn't work anymore. We would repeat restaurant, but we would not stay.\n",
      "Newly renovated hotel beautiful and functional excellent views from the restaurant and nice attention\n",
      "The restaurant on the top floor, all glazed, has fantastic views and the cocktails are spectacular. Very friendly staff.\n",
      "Amazing brunch!Sushi bar and desserts are 10, but the dishes on the menu (especially cod) are exceptional! Repetiremos sure :)\n",
      "Great service. Creative and very identity elaborations.\n",
      "Company that violates many regulations of the worker (moving, excessive weights, co-workers inept but not able, deal with low HR).Lack of hygiene throughout the hotel, the trays where food is deposited for customers directly from the supplier, stored in rooms full of cockroaches and rats. Inventoried pillows and then put in * high standing rooms * counted on garbage cans.I treat disastrously since without asking me for explanations or a previous meeting, I was fired at 3 weeks, giving up and the letter of dismissal.Good company of scammers and comepollas.A little greeting from a former worker.\n",
      "Spectacular in every way. Highlighting first of all the attention of all the staff and the kind treatment received at all times, always willing to what you need, is something that seems obvious that it must be so but in many good hotels it does not happen. The hotel has a minimalist Japanese design but with all the amenities you may need. The beds are very comfortable in which rest is guaranteed. Everything is thought that the client is comfortable during their stay. Both the lights and the curtains work with buttons, which at first cost me a little to understand the operation, but with a little trial everything is solved. Finally the food, who has been in a Nobu restaurant knows what is hidden behind, the product is unbeatable and the production is incredible. The sushi bar is second to none if you don't go to Japan. The room service is also very good. For breakfast I would recommend the eggs Benedict. I forgot to highlight the incredible views of Barcelona and the good existing communications being located next to the Sants station. A place to repeat every time you return to Barcelona.\n",
      "I had high expectations but the night was disappointing me. We arrived about 40 minutes before and, of course, we were having a drink at the bar until the time of our reservation, so far.They took us to our table 15 minutes late despite the table being ready, and we were frankly very cold but we thought it would be just waiting, our surprise came when we sat down to double cold. Horrible!All the tables of two commented on the cold and we repeatedly asked that he will finally graduate almost in the desserts turned it off.A shame not to enjoy a dinner of ‚Ç¨ 200 for the cold, but this was not the only thing the very attentive waiter recommended several dishes and asked us about something we did not want.Kindly tell you not to chop much and especially that nothing carried onion or chives, obviously as attached in the photos he wrote down but kitchen made great mistakes.Finally we had to wait longer than desired for both coffees and for the account. It is understood that nothing can be perfect in an inauguration but to be disgusted by the climate of Alaska and that they do not meet the basic ones that are requested, disappointing.\n",
      "The meeting rooms are fine, and the food, Japanese and national, fantastic\n",
      "A bit too elitist (price). I had gone before and I think there are now too many tables and noise. The views were better appreciated before\n",
      "Excellent frame service at the entrance and Lorenzo at the bar !!!\n",
      "The location is a bit too far, good service, best view, great breakfast.\n",
      "Disappointing, they confuse exclusivity with arrogance and arrogance.We will not return.\n",
      "We were in the restaurant, spectacular views, unbeatable service, delicious food.\n",
      "Ok, although expensive to repeat ...\n",
      "A very cozy and quiet place\n",

      "They are trying to do something with the attack on the hospitality industry\n",
      "I am referring to the last continuous schedule proposal, made to the government of Catalonia today. I think that it is time, finally, to define once and for all what is a Bar and what is a Restaurant. Last time allowed is 7.30 am to 9.30 am and from 1.00 pm to 3.30 pm. Well I want to know which restaurant opens at 7.30? If the Bars have had 4.5 hours a day, we Restaurants only 2.50 hours a day and with more qualified personnel and more costs. Now that you are going to ask for the Gremi de Restauraci√≥ de Barcelona \"Until 20.00 continuous hours\". Again all for the Bars! What do we do from 7.30 to 12.00? And what do we do from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.? And where is dinner, which is the most important for all restaurants in the world? We are only doing the interests of the Bars and nothing for the Restaurants. Change your mindset! It is already afternoon if you want to boast of being European.\n",
      "Great service. Excellent attention ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n",
      "On Wednesday we hope to see you at the hospitality concentration in Sant Jaume, there we will see if you really represent someone in Catalonia\n",
      "They work a lot and well for the sector\n",
      "Being part of an organization that understands you, knows about the problems we encounter and advises and helps you, is very important. It is a vital tool in times of so many changes, so much bureaucracy and so much paperwork. I am very happy with the treatment received by all the members of the Guild. I congratulate you all!\n",
      "Excellent attention\n",
      "Great service\n",
      "Superprofessionals, always available, very competent in the field and always ready to offer solutions in the tangled and difficult world of hospitality.\n",
      "They do not even try to get together, it's a scam, they're just collecting and they do not help you at all\n",
      "Taking a sumelier course. Kind and attentive.\n",
      "4 Gats Only magic, romanticism left ...Only magic, romanticism and the picturesqueness of its name and walls remain.I could extend, but no, the last \"tenants\" are taking care without wishing that even the mystical name deteriorates ...I have appreciated with my logical claim that in the scarce and reduced letter one of the dishes is the \"baked lamb back\", well, when serving it to the table they present a braon or lower leg, before such part of the animal we ask for explanation to the \"Meter\" (which attends with a white shirt and no tie) ensuring that that part they understand by the \"Back\" and that the \"Chef\" thus considers that part as such and that if the letter expresses \" back they serve that part of the animal. We were speechless .... and we ordered another dish.We also had a reservation, we arrived on time and we had 45 minutes on the street ....Something has changed right?\n",

      "Super recommended to have some wines and tapas. Very correct prices for the good quality of the wine and food. Exceptional attention.\n",
      "Stayed 4 days out of the 10 day trip to Barcelona!The staff are so friendly that I can relax and go!I am most satisfied with the hotels I have visited so far.If you are thinking of a hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãyou must visit it!!!!\n",
      "It is unique because one side of the hotel is the ruins of the Roman city walls.It is a small hotel for the price,It's like a place for a few elite, and it's a place with high quality and special service.Clean and friendly staff.The location is also very good.It is a 5-minute walk from Haume Subway Station.The downside is that it is located inside an alley rather than on the side of the road, so even taxi drivers can get lost.\n",
      "Perfect service! If you are going to use the rooftop pool instead, be careful. I don't think water management is separate .. Dove's paradise.\n",
      "I stayed here for a special birthday. From the moment we arrived until we left the service it was great. Beautiful hotel in a perfect location.\n",
      "Superb hotel with magnificent architecturePerfect welcome, top room, to recommend with closed eyes\n",
      "Very nice hotel with lots of charm in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona\n",
      "Fantastic hotel with good location in Barcelona. A plus for the roof terrace with pool although it was quite small. Stylish rooms and awesome breakfast. Even minus that the taxi couldn't really get to the hotel.\n",
      "I find it unacceptable to be charged ‚Ç¨ 9.50 for two coffees. We waited a long time for the waiter to come. It was necessary to go to look for it, it brought the two coffees without more when in any other place of less stars yes that accompany it with some pasta or chocolate. We asked that you bring the bill at the same time. We are still waiting for him to come and collect what we pay and to thank him. I am not complaining so much about the price, which is not bad, but about the nefarious service for a hotel of that category.\n",
      "Great hotel. The location is very good. Before we arrived from Juan, we will start to help us when we arrange and book tours and restaurants. After we arrived, the staff were very helpful and very friendly. The snack bar is also very good, the breakfast is really special. We can't miss this and we would like to praise all employees and hotel management. It makes our trip to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa beautiful city, more memorable.\n",
      "This is a great \"boutique\" hotel, great location, walking outside, you are in the center of a historic neighborhood, it offers you everything! Excellent bar, tapas restaurant, etc. The staff at the Mercer Hotel Barcelona fully understand the meaning of ‚Äúfirst class‚Äù in every respect! A delicious breakfast, a super \"intimate\" bar, and a great \"live\" tapas bar - \"Le Bouchon\".\n",

      "For some time I wanted to enter I did not dare but one day we decided not really any hotel is in a privileged place, not because the streets are narrow, not because there are more shadows and because you are cooler, but because it is pure history. one of the defense towers of the wall of Barcelona is really a jewel in one of its dining rooms is where the gentlemen met to talk about the misadventures or ventures that were happening in Barcelona and you are very well restored and you can see how important it is It was in its time as nothing happens in vain after its splendor came its decadence because some houses were made with brick bricks plastered but then thank God it was possible to make this great recovery of the place I am sorry that some people who do not know of history leave so bad this place so significant in the from the windows can be seen on the other side of the wall with regard to the stay in the H I have not had the good fortune to sleep in it, but if I had a coffee the waiters with me have been very kind I will even say that they are very kind because they have taught me and let me pass to the place where nothing else can be they stay in the establishment but as I like history with good education and without doing any damage you can enter more than one place I assure you that if you go to Barcelona you can sleep perfectly eat and enjoy our Gothic neighborhood that is really installed in the center I recommend it for its history that if you have a little bit of desire you can take it and read it I was delighted and I will return another day and if I can I will stay to eat I thank the gentlemen of the hotel their kindness for letting me see a bit of so wonderful space\n",

EXCELLENT tasting menu, modifying said menu, for a couple of classics of Chef Harry. A great gastronomic experience, in a hotel without unpleasant and quiet noises.

      "Holaa, Germanic, Korean and Japanese tourists ... this Parador Nacional - which does not belong to Paradores Nacionales, is a comparison - is located in an alley in the Sant Just district of Barcelona. Because the Gothic Quarter does not exist, but is formed by the neighborhoods of La Merc√®. The Pi, Sant Just, the Pla√ßa Nova ... Well, it is located on a street that in other centuries would be gentlemen who would leave the carriages in the courtyards, next to the stairs. At one end, the Baixada de Viladecols slope. On the other, the street Dagueria, and on the other, Baixada de Ca√ßador. It has an order in the uniformed door, as in luxury hotels, bronze plates on the facade ... - one of them, indicates the birth of the founder of \"La Caixa\". In the precinct, he used to rent, before becoming a hotel, a little old man. The nephew heirs grandchildren of the owner duchess, according to neighbors and workers in the neighborhood, sold the entire building.\n",

      "The restaurant, is one of the most emblematic spaces of the Mercer Hotel Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe deceased Chef Jean Luc Figueras offered his most intimate market cuisine. \"THE MERCER RESTAURANT RECOVERED ONE OF THE PRECURSORS OF THE BARCELONA KITCHEN\" Jean Luc Figueras was a forerunner of Barcelona's modern cuisine and his French culinary but also Italianate baggage pioneered the first carpaccios or tiramis√∫s.\n",
      "I didn't know which hotel to choose when I went to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãreally. But an acquaintance advised me the Mercer Hotel and I spent months thanking him. I have no words to describe in detail my stay in Barcelona. I needed to disconnect from the stress of my work and when I finished my stay I felt like I was REALLY, literally. I have no complaints, this hotel is P-E-R-F-E-C-T-O. My special thanks to Mr. Francesc Holgado for knowing how to lead this earthly paradise in Barcelona. Next year, 2014, rest assured that I will go to spend my vacations at the Mercer Hotel. Thank you!\n",
      "I have been disappointed, very expensive prices. Correct service The bar has a cold atmosphere, maybe too dark. On the other hand there is an interior patio but it is not defined if it can be used as a terrace or not. If you want to go out at night the area is complicated, very narrow streets of the Gothic quarter.\n",
      "There is a new proposal in the city that will not disappoint singles, whether they are posh, modern or from any other urban \"tribe.\"A classy place that brings together endless proposals for singles, married, separated and couples in Barcelona and that must be visited at least once (although you will surely repeat): the Mercer hotel.The Mercer Hotels chain is characterized by locating its luxury hotels in buildings of cultural, heritage and artistic interest in the historic centers of cities and, in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãit has been located in one of the most historic neighborhoods, the Gothic. In fact, one of the rooms in his restaurant is one of the old walls of Barcelona.Although today, what I fervently recommend is the Mercerino vermouth, the tapas area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel.Quality, good price and a somewhat \"ca√±√≠\" decoration define the Mercer's tapas bar. If you go, you cannot leave without trying their potatoes, the croquettes (of course ...), bravas and the potato omelette. Delicious!!!One of the hotel's advantages is that you can take vermouth in various spaces: the vermouth area, the interior patio and the terrace. Ideal, right?I am also going to tell you a secret, if you go to the Mercer with \"a friend\" (wink) and you want to surprise him, opt for the interior terrace as well as serving the Mercerino dishes, they can delight you with breakfast, brunch ... That, surely you will ascend directly to 301, the hotel suite!So girls, you can't waste any more time and go to the Mercer hotel.\n",
      "It is one of the few places where the quality of the food, the service and even the moderate price are in keeping with the decoration and the seriousness of the walls that were used to collect Barcelona.\n",

We were lucky to meet this new Hotel and were amazed at the comfort and facilities on offer. The quality of the food is amazing, the atmosphere friendly and the design perfectly adapted to a Hotel of these characteristics. You can park in the Cathedral car park on 'Via Laietana' which makes access very easy, as it is only two minutes away.

      "I was having a drink on the terrace with my cousins ‚Äã‚Äãand the truth is that the bartender treated me better than, for example, the manager who after they invite us to an elaborate shot I have to listen to how the manager kept scolding him, first thinking that we hadn't paid and then the boy hurried up that there were more people waiting when we were the only ones at the bar .... also to say that waiting we stayed until we got up and paid after a while waiting for the bill to what it seems the manager either didn't realize it or didn't care. Very happy with the treatment of the rest of the waiters but in particular the Gambian mixologist.\n",

      "The terrace is good with views and such, the fault is the service, in a hurry for us to come every minute to ask if we wanted something else, picking up the half-finished glasses, the potato omelette that they serve you for ‚Ç¨ 10 was bought from the super and tiny one, the one at Mercadona is bigger‚Ä¶ and for him, they wanted to charge us ‚Ç¨ 10 per person to keep a birthday cake (bought by us) and serve us plates to eat it.

After 1 minute the Argentine receptionist came out and rudely told me to \"move on from there.\" I understand that it is private property, but kick a person sitting down like that? You talk about \"heartfelt human connections\" on their website. Well, you should start by learning how to treat people. I will never recommend your hotel to anyone. A category hotel is not determined by the stars.\n",

The kindness, the excellent customer service and that black rice with octopus and ali-oli accompanied by the fresh burrata with tomato made us feel at home.A restaurant with all the characteristics to be a big one but without losing the proximity of making you feel like family.By the way, guys from Vadegust, do you remember that we said that black rice would make us win the Spanish Championship.

Paco, the chef, came out and showed them to us alive. Richer than lobster, I recommend it if it is on the menu.The weekly menu is very good, price, quality and sufficient quantity.

      "Two years ago I won a raffle for a dinner for two.I remember exactly the faces that the waiter made to me when he served me at that time.It made me feel that I was going to beg, the treatment was one of the most arrogant, arrogant and unprofessional, the worst of all is that it was my birthday, uuff I have no more words to describe how bad I had it.The fact that I have been benefited with a dinner through a raffle does not mean that no one was going to pay for it, since the business that was in charge of all this had paid the bill according to the knowledge I have.Anyway, otherwise I had money to pay for it.I recognize that the food is totally exquisite, it is a charm, it gives that unique flavor to the palate, I congratulate the chef for preparing such professional and dignified dishes that you can find in few places.The place was quite clean, tidy and very organized, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the other waitress or I don't know if she was the manager, she was very friendly, attentive and helpful.\n",
      "Fantastic place The daily menu at ‚Ç¨ 16 and ‚Ç¨ 24 is exceptional. The letter with a lot of variety .. The foie with caramelized onions and toasts is a past, this is just an example. Rice with all varieties are good, today we have tried the rice with crayfish and sepia rs extraordinary. Very reasonable prices for quantity and quality. The fast service, very friendly and attentive. The mistress worries that the clients are satisfied with the choice of the meal. I recommend it. Oh! Book table. Today we have been lucky to go there without reservation before 1:15 p.m. and we have been able to sit. Behind our usual client they could not please it. At 2 pm all the tables were full. If you leave Tarragona, do not miss the opportunity ü§ó\n",

      "They have good Rice dishes, daily menu, and good fish, good service! better to book\n",
      "Restaurant a few steps from the park, on the outside it may seem small in reality there is a large room in the tavern also accessible by a comfortable side door for strollers and the elderly. Tapas menu and typical of the area, good and abundant hamburgers, big salads, good special dish. Dodge pasta and pizza with stones. Courteous staff perhaps a little too much of a run, average prices but justified by the proximity to the park\n",
      "2 euros for coffee. Only one kind. Drink coffee only while waiting for admission to Guell Park. There are few places to wait in moderation.The food and service are very ... The floor with the counter is very narrow and crowded, but there is a spacious and spacious space downstairs.\n",

      "After Park Guell we accidentally came across this cafe. The restaurant is clearly too, because the place is small - a couple of tables on the street, inside opposite the bar counter there are also 5 tables, maybe inside there is a large hall, I don‚Äôt know. At the bar - a showcase of different dishes that you can immediately buy. We took a salad like our olivier (see photo), a baguette with fish, toasts (like everywhere else in Spain they are fried and top with some kind of tomato dressing) and squid - it was just amazingly delicious with a fragrant dressing of olive oil with herbs, garlic and lemon.PS: now when I started looking for this place on Google maps I was surprised by a very low rating - 1 out of 5 !! I absolutely sincerely say that everything was delicious to us and the food was fresh.\n",
      "I did not order very good pizza and other beer. A good stop before visiting the park.\n",
      "We really enjoyed! Quickly tasty hearty! One paella for two young ladies is enough\n",
      "Right food\n",
      "Tourist scam. A rotten welcome with the added bonus of a rattling voice. Outrageous price for the service. (‚Ç¨ 10 for 2 coffee bases and 2 tea bags)\n",
      "For what we were looking for more than enough and still good especially pasta for children. Staff (only 2 people) in a hurry and for this reason it is sometimes hasty and not very helpful. Prices are also excessively above average even compared to more tourist areas of Barcelona.\n",
      "Worst \"restaurant\" of my life. Unfriendly staff and barely edible food\n",
      "I do not understand the previous comments.Has the restaurant changed owners in the meantime ?!I suggested a change because when I went in March 2019 it was the restaurant iberic fusion.Near Park G√ºell. Pleasant surroundings. Friendly staff. This is not gastronomic cuisine, certainly, but appreciable however. I recommend you. The price is correct given the proximity to the park.\n",
      "Disgusting place. With vile staff and tainted churros\n",
      "Steps for the sandwich, on the other hand we were there for that, but to be treated like fish in the face by the waitress ... Also no !! I don't want to believe that the reason was the nationality and the fact that we were all women, but the bad impression was that.\n",
      "I put a star because they leave no less. The bread I can not even cut it from how hideous it is, the hard cuttlefish, the squid swimming in oil and reheated and the small chicken, and above all inedible, has been done for at least three days. !!!!!!\n",
      "ABUSERS. Not even half a star deserve. We entered and we found three people behind the counter (the owners apparently). We asked if any dish was gluten-free and they answered (in Catalan). We understood that they did not know what gluten was (rare in Spain where everyone is informed about it). We asked, trying to explain ourselves and they answered us, DO YOU SEE BREAD ON SOME DISHES? WHY DON'T YOU LOOK. The place was empty, it wasn't that bad. We took a deep breath and this time we asked if the paella in the photo (which was not in sight) was to share, to which they responded by shouting, ‚ÄúBORING WITH YOUR QUESTIONS, THEY ARE THE AGONY OF THESE TOURISTS! Well, I hope this comment helps other tourists not come. Supposedly there is another restaurant with the same name around the corner, very well rated on TripAdvisor, do not be fooled.\n",
      "The worst place I have ever been! Very expensive, bad treatment, bad atmosphere, small and seedy sandwiches, they shouted at us, they charge the glass and the plate. The owner treated us fatally ... He wanted us to eat what he wanted we could not even choose ... The girl in the box was a screamer. In general some edges. Bad food and hot drinks. To go to the service you have to ask for a key and present a ticket. Pre-cooked food and microwave it.\n",
      "Staff couldn't be guaranteed but the food was really good. Personally, I recommend you try pizza here. Koreans are not salty, so you won't fail.\n",
      "Expensive and bad food (I paid 40 euros to eat cold snacks and food that tastes like old) and pay only in cash. The restaurant is self-service, when the food is ready, the attendants warn and customers look at the counter. As I don't speak Spanish, I didn't understand the first time the attendant called my plate and asked in English if it was mine. The answer I received was asking if I am deaf because he had already spoken. Bad experience, do not recommend.\n",
      "We were not in the restaurant but we were in the park it is a joke place, if you have been there you will probably not come again.\n",
      "Grumpy, rude and rude staff, they make sarcastic (obviously in their language) behind customers' backs.Bad food at out of the ordinary prices: (two plates of paella,plus burned, at a price of 26 ‚Ç¨).Wrong orders, exorbitant prices and scarce food are the order of the day!Ruined evening, an experience not to be repeated at all!Their only good fortune is to have a good location income, close to the crowded Park G√ºell area.\n",
      "It's a low season ..... very friendly and delicious ~ !!If the table is small, put it on purposely\n",
      "One of Barcelona's finest restaurants, simple and excellent service.\n",
      "We sat down at a table, went to order and use the toilet, the service pushed us out of the shutters that we were first ordered and then used the toilet. 200 meters away, they are local with normal, courteous service. I do not recommend\n",
      "A nice place, with good food and unbeatable service. A greeting from Lanzarote to the gentleman who attended us üòäüåπ\n",
      "It is a starless restaurant. I can not say that the taste is second and unkindness. It is because the position is so good when seeing that it is still doing business even if it is so bad even though it is so bad now .. I have a leg pain and a hunger, I am looking at the menu to order, I cry out to order soon, my grandfather is annoyed ... I almost throw food down. Never go.\n",
      "Poor service and care. I have 4 small children, as I was not going to consume what and the owner thought it was enough, he said he did not serve me. A shame!\n",
      "Really unpleasant, all very expensive and low quality. Avoid it even if being halfway up the climb to Park Guel it would seem a pleasant refreshment\n",
      "Fast service. Friendly welcome. Downside: insufficiently heated room in January\n",
      "Not even worth a single star. Loud staff standing and screaming at each other. Occasionally, the ceramics in the kitchen hit so high against one another that you can't even talk at the service.\n",
      "Nice food. They also locked the toilet door, when we went after 15 minutes for a toilet we were told that we had to order again! People are unacceptable!\n",
      "nice people and tasty\n",
      "One of the most rapturous waiters in Barcelona. I guess they do not expect anyone to come back because it's for tourists\n",

      "TOURIST PLEASE DON‚ÄôT EAT HERE.Horrifying place.Very high prices, the \"hot\" food is cold and they reheat it in a microwave or iron and on top of it badly reheated and of poor quality. They do not have table service but you go to the bar and they serve you as if it were the supermarket checkout. Bad manners. For having they do not even have to pay with a credit card. This company survives thanks to Parc G√ºell if they would not be closed a long time ago. It is a shame that tourists are scammed like that since they will get a bad impression of the city because of locals like this.\n",
      "Fast food for tourists\n",
      "Terrible place, expensive and everything overheated. We asked for cuttlefish and apart from being raw, they had it already made and it looked like cardboard. The reheated potatoes. When he asked what the croquettes were, he said \"delicious chicken\" and what a surprise, frozen from a lifetime that they sell in the supermarket. Bad treatment on the part of the staff, they made some clients get up, taking their plates, repeating before the absorbed glance of all the clients that the table was reserved. Bad faces when using the toilet because they must open the door for you. Very high prices, small plates and no flavor. They take advantage of the location but they are not worth anything. Recommendations: Do not enter.\n",
      "Typical tapas restaurant for tourists is not bad really.\n",
      "It is unthinkable to run into people like that. Very expensive, edges, foul-mouthed, loud, no empathy, disrespectful.Regarding all cold food, preheated food.Do not enter this \"bar\"\n",
      "The food is salty and poor. The staff seems to hate their own customers. I strongly recommend that you find somewhere else and eat.\n",
      "For 1 Bear and 1 Vermouth 19 Euro\n",
      "The worst place I have visited in Spain, in addition to being super expensive, you must pay in cash if you consume less than $ 10 eu, to use the terrace you have to pay additional and the staff is very unkind. And finally, they have let us consume and then tell us that in a few minutes they close.\n",
      "A shame of place. I give it 1 star because you can't give less. I'm from the neighborhood of a lifetime, I live 100 meters from the Restaurant. I know the owners by sight and they know me by sight (because they have other souvenir shops next to my house). To start at the tables outside, it says \"self-service\", because nothing, I go in with my friend and ask, we say we want to have something, the waitress (daughter of the owner) tells us that we cannot have anything, that we can only eat !!, Sorry ??, I tell you that I am from the neighborhood of a lifetime, also there were a lot of empty tables. Well, nothing, he tells me again that we cannot drink anything, that we can only eat !!, it seems very strong to me!, That lack of respect and bad treatment. I have been in the barrel for 30 years !! The owners (father and daughter) already have a reputation for being weird and unfriendly in the neighborhood. I honestly do not understand! They also always have empty tables, there are very few people, and they have told me that they eat fatally. I do not advise you to enter.\n",
      "Dear, cold, dirty, and unlovable! We are afraid of being sick\n",
      "Very rude.They don't let you have a coffee. They only take care of you if you are going to eat and in our case it was breakfast time and they only allowed one person from the group to stay, while the other two who only wanted coffee had to get up from the table. I smell the customer service.Very expensive.\n",
      "Bad mannered, stupidly expensive, all the food sucks\n",
      "Unfortunately you cannot give 0 stars! We were kicked out because we hadn't ordered within 3 '. Card and restaurant absolutely filthy. Probably the worst location in all of Barcelona.\n",
      "Average treatment, normal food.\n",
      "Sandwich at 5 ‚Ç¨, cashier who takes us for morons and poorly polished, to go as a last resort. In addition, the tables are not washed.\n",
      "A slice of bread ‚Ç¨ 1.50 ...\n",
      "There are very delicious traditional dishes\n",
      "Outrageously bad, rude staff. We were shouted at and kicked out. I was traveling with my parents, I've never seen anything like it. We're exemplary tourists, this is the first time I've given a review - I'm still in shock.\n",
      "I have never seen a restaurant as bad, I would not even have put a star if I could, the food is tasteless and at exorbitant prices (3 ‚Ç¨ peach juice of 10 mL) the terrace is sloping.The voice of the one at the counter remains memorable, I left deaf.\n",
      "Do not go here. I got SHOUTED at for politely asking for water. Owner freely interpreted I wanted tap water (the nerve ...!), I hadn't even specified. Food quality and price are wildly disproportional. Run to the hills.//Avoid at all costs. The owner yelled at me for asking for water because he freely interpreted that he wanted it from the \"free\" tap (God forbid). The food is EXCELLENT and mediocre. Flees.\n",
      "Very bad and unfriendly service. Very expensive ! Tourist trap !!\n",
      "They threw us out for trying to drink something at 5pm, absurd and incomprehensible.We strolled through the Parc Guell with the family, my wife, my in-laws, the little one and me, and decided to stop for a drink in a bar. We saw this one that was next to the park and that it was almost empty, there were two tables as busy; We sat at the table that was free on the terrace. The waiter saw us and made a sign that we would sit down now. My father-in-law who took the opportunity to go to the service, asks for some gin and tonis and some coffees for the terrace, and the immediate response of the rude and unpleasant person in charge was: we only serve dinner, you can't have a drink. Without even arguing in the face of such absurd and disrespectful treatment, we got up and left, surrounded by the warm voice of the person in charge of giving insults to our clear sign of discomfort. In summary, a site that clearly only subsists thanks to the influx of tourists with a manager who makes owners lose money by mistreating and underestimating the local public. Terrible experience ...\n",
      "02/11/2017: the worst place I've eaten in my life. In box a woman screaming continuously and looking at customers with a face of total madness. The waiter, slapping, addressing people in a way that is more impolite. A half bottle of water 2.5 ‚Ç¨ and you have to get up to pick it up, do not think to ask to bring it ... I have done it and the \"lord\" with bad forms grabs a sign that puts \"self service\" li sticks on the table and says \"here self service\" .... it really is a movie site, horror movies. The very bad paella, they have no idea. But the best thing is the bad education of the staff ... it is sad that there are people like that ... and sadder that they still act in this way they are covered with money taking advantage of the tourists who \"fall\" and then do not return there in their life. ..DO NOT GO DO NOT GO DO NOT GO !!!\n",
      "I do not like the food, but I do not get 10 Euros for change.\n",
      "The location determines the price tag, but tasty and fast.\n",
      "Very expensive for the size of the portions. They have a photo of the portions outside and when you enter they are very small. A sandwich ‚Ç¨ 6 and a bottle of water from 50cl to ‚Ç¨ 2.50.\n",
      "Rude, poorly stuffed sandwiches .. dear!\n",
      "Services more than average rather expensive a slice of bread one euro coffee two euro M. lack of smile\n",
      "I would have preferred to spend 100 euros in a medium-low quality place than 12 euros in this place.\n",
      "tasty but expensive\n",
      "I only give it one because you can't put less. Very expensive and very bad.In addition the service is the worst\n",
      "Very unfriendly staff, we only had a question about parking and were immediately expelled from the house\n",
      "Quality reasonable price.\n",
      "They take advantage of the privilege of being close to the Park G√ºell.\n",
      "Enter to take a cut, it is a bar specialized in tourists, the owners speaking fatal to the tourists, very unfriendly.The food is shit and also very expensive, and for the cut he charged me 2 euros, I do not recommend anyone to go.\n",
      "Bad and very expensive. I give it a star because you can't put less, in the box there is a woman screaming mega edge. Don't even think about going, üëéüëéüëé\n",
      "Superb, exceptional experience. The best of all is the pleasant sensation of being able to enjoy its haute cuisine without artifice, without paraphernalia, without ego; It is simply a product of the highest quality, prepared with technical mastery and served with exquisite treatment. If you think that it is not a site for you because of its price or because it is an elitist site, not at all. Worth. You will not regret it.\n",
      "Gastronomic show in a wonderful environment and with perfect service.Tasting menu of 6 starters, 6 courses and 3 desserts and all dishes are pure perfection. Spectacular product, brutal technique and gastronomic orgasm as a result.Impressive winery. Noelia presenting the brutal dishes, her brother conducting the orchestra in the sublime room and Mart√≠n a gentleman.Eskerrik kasko family.\n",
      "SAFETY PIN. It is the word that describes this place. An excellent deal, unique flavors and a spectacular PAIRING, the best I have tasted to date.The excellent team at MB is an experience worth living ...\n",
      "Today we went to this restaurant with the hope that we would be surprised by its cuisine and creativity. It was our first 3 üåü and the truth is that we had high expectations, since we have visited many Michelin stars and we have always considered Mart√≠n a god of this world. Well, we have been quite disappointed because, although we have eaten well, we have not reached the gastronomic climax that we were looking for. Our assessment is always in value for money, so we consider it quite weak, we have added the kokotxas to the tasting menu hoping to eat the best of our lives and we were surprised that they were worse than in the Donosti restaurant that we ate yesterday. In addition, two of the dishes that have been brought to us: the clams with chlorophyll and the red shrimp carpaccio have practically gone as they have come, that if the head of the room has realized that we have not liked anything and has quickly offered us one Alternative, very friendly! In short, I don't know if it was the menu, the Chef's day, that was not successful or that creativity has gotten out of hand, but it certainly is not at the level of its price. We will continue visiting the Michelin stars with the same enthusiasm that we come to delight ourselves with the cuisine of the great Mart√≠n Berasategui.\n",
      "Great, worth paying for the tasting menu! A gustatory, sensory and emotional experience.\n",
      "Awesome cooking demonstration. The exquisite treatment. Out of 10 everything.\n",
      "K say about a place like this, everything in detail, if you don't like something (rare thing) they change it without further ado, super good service, food without words, real culinary art !!! There are dishes that are sad to eat, how beautiful they are .... My wife is a bit exquisite to eat, she liked EVERYTHING.\n",
      "Great everything. I would not really know which dish to highlight. The juiciest hake I've ever eaten. And the spectacular lemon dessert.Exceptional treatment, charming room staff.A wonderful environment. It would have been great at all if you had your coffee in the garden with the wonderful hydrangeas they have.To top it all off, meeting Mart√≠n in person has been an honor.\n",
      "Good tasting and pairing menu. Very abundant. All a delight !!\n",
      "Simply spectacular.\n",
      "A gastronomic experience to do at least once in your life. Blends of flavors and textures with a brilliant presentation.\n",
      "Ultimate experience on the plate!Recommendation of exceptional Spanish wines at reasonable prices :-)The \"olives\" alone are worth a visit ...\n",
      "It's your fault\n",
      "They gave me a meal at the Restaurate for my birthday, and they had the detail of taking out the dessert with a candle, and when I said goodbye they gave me a dedicated book by Martin.Quite a detail! Thanks!\n",
      "- You can see all the content in our INSTAGRAM profile @ rest.shooting‚ûïThe best cook in Spain and the world, but still a better person. Martin Berasategui is a real star. The kitchen without words. It is a place that, if you can, you must go once in your life. To not stop enjoying and forgetting everything during the three hours that the meal lasts.The service and attention carried out by the entire team is magnificent. Not a but. Everything perfectly explained, served ... We are still in shock with this gastronomic experience. I hope you are lucky enough to be able to live it. We simply convey that we continue with an emotional hangover (and a little bit of the other üòÉ) with what happened on Saturday.\n",
      "Impressive all magnificent experience.Thanks.\n",
      "Excellent food, unbeatable attention. They adjust the menu to taste, specifications if there are allergies, you can not eat raw, alcohol or whatever. IMPECCABLE both food and service\n",
      "Little can we add to a magnificent Martin Berasategui\n",
      "Its stars speak for themselves, a unique place and an unrepeatable experience.\n",
      "Ideal to enjoy a cuisine of enormous technical, artistic and avant-garde precision, in a sophisticated and privileged environment. Located in a chalet-mansion.\n",
      "Brutal experience. All the dishes without exception were of impressive quality, in every way. Probably the best 3 * Michelin we have visited to date.\n",
      "Spectacular quality of the dishes, very original, perfectly cooked and with an unbeatable presentation.Easy to adapt the tasting menu if you don't like something (not only if you are allergic)However,- Although the attention was 10 in general, we had to call the table manager a couple of times to clarify a couple of things due to the changes in the menu.- The value for money in general seemed expensive and above all we found it wrong that with the cost of the tasting menu they charged us ‚Ç¨ 6-8 for each welcome drink and another ‚Ç¨ 6-7 for each coffee. It seems to us that the smallest detail would have been to include at least the coffees in the menu price ...\n",
      "Martin Berasategui is one of the greatest chefs in world gastronomy.Every dish that he puts on the table is full of technique and passion for what he does and always respecting the product and the season.Highlight the very bright place, on the terrace you are feeling great.The very thorough explanation of the dishes and the excellent wine cellar which says a lot about the great room equipment it has.It is one of the restaurants that you have to go to once in your life at least.\n",
      "Very good attention, good views did not surprise me and I thrilled their kitchen ..I will be back..\n",
      "The food, spectacular, out of 10 !! The treatment of the staff is impeccable, very correct. Everything at an exquisite level. A pity that the chef, Mart√≠n, was not there to have greeted the diners and been able to chat with him. Definitely an experience to enjoy from start to finish.\n",
      "Very good experience in a wonderful place. Good cuisine and good staff. To do at least once in life.\n",
      "Spectacular 3 Michelin star restaurant, from our beloved MARTIN !! A dream come true, satisfaction, and above all that they make you feel at home is priceless! Meeting him in person and being able to enjoy his great hand in gastronomy is something impressive.It is recommended to order the Tasting Menu with various dishes and various desserts. It has its own parking. And above all, ask for a reservation in advance.If you can do this even once in a lifetime, DO IT!#Triplegarrote#BigMartin#Thank you for letting us meet youüíôüí™üèΩ\n",
      "Exceptional attention and amazing dishes. Fantastic experience, highly recommended for those who enjoy incredible flavors, textures that are not found anywhere, and \"recipes\" that do not exist anywhere else. From the tasting menu, especially spectacular olives, gilda and dessert of \"lemon\", although it is impossible to put any paste to the rest of dishes, all exquisite. CONGRATULATIONS and see you soon!\n",
      "Without a doubt a unique experience for many reasons. Outstanding attention, spectacular, bright place where nothing distracts you from the culinary experience. As for the kitchen, what to say about some of the best ... For me the Oyster is top top !!\n",
      "Orthodox style restaurant.Elegant and attentive service, you can enjoy dishes with your eyes and tongue.Start at 13:00, enjoy the course slowly, and finally exit at around 16:30 with hate. I took a taxi to San Sebastian Airport, and I was able to get in on the 18 o'clock flight.\n",
      "After trying other Michelin star restaurants, with very high expectations, the dishes did not turn out to be what I expected.Very good place and staff. Very nice Martin.\n",
      "We have been to Lasarte and chose your restaurant for an anniversary celebration. It has been an unforgettable experience, all the stars highly deserved, all the dishes impeccable, the foie gras and the spectacular desserts, but the attention and service in the room stood out above all, especially with Noelia who treated us exceptionally and made us feel like at home. Congratulations for the great job that the whole team is doing !!\n",
      "Hotel with exquisite decoration, well located and as it should happen in everyone, my dog ‚Äã‚Äãwas always with me, except in the dining areas, spa and gym.All workers in this place were extremely sympathetic.If I return to Pamplona, ‚Äã‚Äãthis is where I want to settle in, thank you very much!\n",
      "Fantastic, from start to finish. All the unbeatable staff, great rooms and a dining experience worth considering. We have been going for years and it is impossible to think of giving it less than 5 stars on any of the occasions.\n",
      "Beautiful and quiet hotel, spacious and comfortable rooms. The restaurant service leaves much to be desired, a scarce buffet breakfast, a reduced and repetitive menu, the room service is the same menu as the restaurant, between courses they take more than an hour, we ordered the beef chop and we returned it because it was inedible.Very friendly staff, good cleaning.I would go back to this hotel but without stepping on the restoration. Undeserved Michelin star.\n",
      "Elegant and secluded hotel.Very modern and stylish facilities.The food spicy is excellent.\n",
      "Spectacular both the site and the serviceProfessional and very friendly waitersThe food very very good and very well presentedFor my A's in everything\n",
      "Very quiet, beautiful place, you can take walks around, they do not give you food if you are not staying, and you have to ask permission to have a drink at their place. Not for all audiences. Upper class.\n",
      "Impressive in every way !! Excellent treatment with beautiful rooms and perfect facilities ... We will not only repeat Hotel Alma when we return to Pamplona, ‚Äã‚Äãbut we will also recommend it 200% to everyone who comes to this area. Thanks for the experience !!\n",
      "The hotel is considered to be one of the best in Spain and rightly so. Nowhere was the service so warm and professional. The hotel itself also shines with a select design and larger than average rooms. We wanted to buy the two expansive armchairs in our Executive Suite for ourselves at home - only to find out that each of them costs over 10,000 euros. Dinner and breakfast were also great and to top it off, we were allowed to have the SPA to ourselves for 2 hours. The hotel can compete successfully with the best in the world and we would not choose another in the area in the future.\n",
      "Wonderful experienceSuper attentive and pleasant staffA fantasy the room\n",
      "I generally agree with the opinion of jean-pierre posted a month agoThe express breakfast is minimalist.Floor of the room encrusted with stains that do not go away.The bedding is very goodSpa and parking included in the room rate are appreciable\n",
      "A secluded place, with respect to the city, and quiet where they exist. Friendly and attentive service to the fullest, and the rooms, hyper modern and comfortable ... chapeau site\n",
      "Marvelous!!The family stayed for two nights and I can only say good things, from the room that was very clean with spectacular mattresses to a very good breakfast and a spa that, due to the covid issue, the family could enjoy alone (I recommend booking in advance)Special mention to the kindness of the hotel staff and especially to Rub√©n who was a charm\n",
      "Excellent. Both in quality, presentation and attention.\n",
      "Great value for the price. It has a SPA. The staff was super friendly and attended to our bike storage needs, late check out, etc.\n",
      "I was there with my girlfriend and our dog we stayed for a weekend for our first anniversary. the rooms are large and modern. The best restaurant very good cuisine. quality.The cod you could tell that it was fresh, little done raw but very rich .....The best torrija I have ever eaten in my life, I would have eaten 4 or 5 ... spectacular!\n",
      "To put a \"but\", the balconies of the rooms do not get the sun ... only the suites ...Excellent care and cleaning\n",
      "Not a 5 star, 3 star service !!We have been coming to this hotel for several years, but the quality of service has declined significantly. We felt the owners had changed?This experience will not leave us with good memories! Nice room, nice design, convenient parking. On the other hand concerning the ALMA restaurant we did not appreciate the cuisine, no menu for the choice of wines, the attitude of the unprofessional and improvised staff.We had booked a room with breakfast included, except it was very limited and incomprehensible for a 5 star hotel. No possibility of having eggs, nor plates of cold meats and cheeses, but 2 small sandwiches per person and a pastry. We had to pay the supplements for an unfortunate little extra sandwich and a pastry (Scandalous).I would say this is a good 4 star hotel with service that drops more to that of a 3 star.From the room, we had the view of a crane and an adjoining building site just in front of the balconies of the rooms, a building that is being built almost in their garden ...\n",
      "The times that I have been it has been on the terrace that they have at the back that gives a section of the Paseo del Arga! The terrace is spectacular, easy to park and pleasant treatment by the staff who attended us! I recommend it\n",
      "I find it a nice place to dine and have a drink on the terrace. I have not had a chance to see the rooms, but I get the feeling that they will be very nice. The Michelin star is well earned.\n",
      "My wife and I were very surprised and we loved it. The design of the entire hotel / restaurant ...... the views ... the rooms equipped with every detail, the unbeatable attention of the waiters ... friendliness, cleanliness, the SPA is the best. But above all above all, what amazed us the most is the food. It's a display of flavors in every bite ...My wife and I do not have children but we have a dog, we take it with us and I enjoy it to the fullest .......... the great esplanade that is next door was great for us for walks. We are looking forward to repeating.\n",
      "Large room, small spa but not very crowded, helpful staff.\n",
      "The hotel is very cozy and modern, with very spacious and cozy designer rooms. The service just as spectacular and very attentive to customers.It is the first time we have spent a night in the hotel, but it was the second time we had dinner at a holiday in the hotel, last year for Christmas and this year for New Years Eve. The kitchen should be in the hands of the hotel restaurant, and I should say that it has let us down a bit ... Last year as a novelty we liked it, but this year (despite all the restrictions that no longer depend on the hotel and the Good service they gave us) dinner was a bit repetitive compared to what we had already tried and we found it quite expensive for what was served. And we were surprised that one of the starters, that some diner could not eat it and the rest did not like it either, there was no possibility of change. Being in the end a somewhat fair dinner in a celebration like New Years Eve.I will recommend the hotel to friends and family, but not the alma restaurant. If we would like to try the tasting menu of his other restaurant, the library.But what has been said, grateful for the good service!\n",
      "Very nice and spacious rooms. Personal treatment, both reception and exquisite restoration. Easy parking, under the same hotel. We are repeaters and we will return again.\n",
      "Do you differ in clientele? ... The restaurant at the Alma hotel has been a real disappointment. We had a reservation for two months in the interior patio, we talked in his day to accommodate umbrellas in case it was sunny. When we arrive this day they say that they have put the tables inside in the dining room since it is very hot in the patio ...? (And there are no umbrellas to be seen anywhere, no prior notice by call of the change, nor, although not necessary, an apology for this change). But this is not the worst. Perhaps this I tell without the following would have been all unimportant, but seen what we have seen ... The worst thing was that we were 7, so we had to eat divided into two tables of four due to the distance from the covid, and it turns out that they keep two tables placed at an \"angle\" (like two contiguous sides of a square), between the entrance hall of people and waiters, and an impossible distance to have sporadic conversation between the two groups. The options of the reservation were either interior patio or next to the dining room window. It turns out that in that space of the window, there was a table of 6 or 8, which they reserved for 4 people .... Being 7 people in my group, how do you think of placing our reservation like this? Above we had the reservation for two months, what differences they make between the clientele !! I show a part of the ticket.\n",
      "An elegant, pleasant and very tasteful environment. Rooms with wonderful views and great waiter service. As for the restaurant, it left a lot to be desired in terms of value for money.\n",

      "Very nice rooms. the spa very cold a shame. And the service really bad. That which is a restaurant is not bad at all. For a 5 * it does not meet my expectations.\n",
      "Desert, soulless, unwelcoming. We have eaten in the restaurant, half a menu was missing, and what they have is not attractive. the best, the attention and service of the lady who has attended us. Food is worth nothing. We have paid 127 euros\n",
      "On this occasion, I went to one of the best hotels in Navarra, to enjoy a fantastic meal in its restaurant, although in this hotel they have 2, one the Alma restaurant and the other the La Biblioteca de 1‚≠ê michel√≠n restaurant. Both are led by chef Leandro Gil.This visit is to the Alma, although soon I will go to try The Library.In the Alma you can find an elegant, quiet dining room and if you are also lucky like me, beautiful views.With a fast and attentive service, all you have to do is enjoy the Navarra tradition menu, with seasonal vegetable dishes, some stew and grilled main dishesüî•üî•.Before starting the meal, I let myself be guided by the dining room staff and they offered me an organic Pedro Olivares Merlot wild series wine. Surprising and intense both in smell and in the mouth, I loved it.And as for the food, I started with a couple of appetizers: their gilda accompanied by an incredible oil and an appetizing chistorra.As starters, delicious glass peppers roasted on vine shoots. These Corella peppers, peeled by hand and accompanied by unfiltered oil, left me speechless and without time to take a good photo of them (I couldn't resist üòÇüòÇ)The smell they give off is brutal and the oil that accompanies them makes this dish a 10 for me üòçüòç.I continue with another starter, and this one as a suggestion of the day, the thistle. Delicious thistle accompanied by crunchy almonds. Everything at its point and leaving the plate gleaming.And as the star dish, the fish of the day, a grilled sea bream with its rehash. Fantastic point of the bream, of good size and with a good amount of rehash. So far, the best I have eaten.To top off the meal, the pre-dessert, which is a spherification of pi√±a colada that drove me crazy, I would eat it over and over again.And then a couple of desserts, the homemade carrot cake accompanied by ice cream and a selection of refiner's cheeses (1/2). I can say that the cake is the best I have ever had, what a cakeü§§ü§§ and the selection of cheeses left me speechless.This selection of cheeses is made up of: 36-month-old comt√© cheese, goat cheese with ash, gazta zaharra, idiazabal, chestnut and casar cheese. Wow, I enjoyed it for the palate, and a good way to finish off the wine.I must thank all the staff for this experience, both in the living room to Manu and German, and in the kitchen to Leandro, Nerea and Sergio.A pleasure and I hope to be able to return soon.\n",
      "As always, everything is perfect.\n",
      "Comfortable, quiet place and excellent treatment\n",
      "We booked the hotel for Valentine's Day and chose this because it had a spa. When we arrived, the spa pool was not hot we had 1h and after 5 min we left because we were cold, otherwise The service at the reception was very friendly, the rooms were very nice.\n",
      "Unbeatable luxury establishment. Cozy staff. Dojo explanations of what we can do, see or eat in the city. Noisy, well-connected hotel location in the center.\n",

      "Comfortable comfortable and very nice staff\n",

      "Good skewers, good people\n",
      "The great luxury of having a lot of space. Apartment size room, shower like a ballroom. Exquisite service.The library restaurant deserves a special mention. First Michelin star more than deserved, others will come. Original, precise, precious, an unforgettable menu like an adventure between orchard and history.The sumelier, creative will make you live sensations far from the established canons.\n",
      "Very quiet and all pending details. And with a charging point for VE (DC Tesla). recommendable\n",
      "Elegance and style are perceived in each and every detail of the hotel; from its spectacular common areas to the comfort of its beds and pillows to the gels and creams chosen to make bathing or showering a unique olfactory experience.Two thumbs up to Alma's chef, last night I had the best thistles of my life for dinner. Two thumbs up to the maitre d ', exquisite in the treatment. Two thumbs up to the reception, attentive 24 hours even with a single guest staying at the hotel.Frankly .. a 9.9. Ten does not exist;)\n",
      "A fabulous hotel with a futuristic design and advanced technology, all the openings work with a fingerprint. The staff is very kind and competent. The rates are very competitive as in my case I had the graris minibar and access to the spa. I hope I can come back.\n",
      "We only know the terrace but we will return. Very calm. Nice sunset views. Very well attended\n",
      "Great pet friendly! We went with our dog and they treated him like another member of our family! It is wonderful to find a pet-friendly 4 *. And above with spa!\n",
      "Beautiful facility, great hotel. Optimal and very silent position just a few minutes from the center. For several accesses using the fingerprint .... courteous staff in all services. Personally, I advise you to improve the internal indications, entering from the garag (free) I found some difficulties to reach the reception. For everything else ok.\n",
      "We love going to Muga de Beloso to rest in peace while being near the center of Pamplona. The hotel is comfortable and luxurious and the staff as usual very warm and welcoming\n",
      "We liked the hotel a lot. We had a room with a terrace. The Spa area is very cool. We didn't eat much at the hotel: a quick breakfast and a dinner, but it was very good. My partner and I would repeat. Near the center.\n",
      "It is a shame to start making a complaint and in my years as a Marketing Consultant I have never done it, but I have felt little taken care of by its cancellation policies.On Saturday night at 9:00 pm my husband and I called and reserved a room to enjoy it but hours later we decided to cancel. We call the hotel to cancel the reservation, first question. Will this reservation not be charged to me? Answer will not charge you.On Wednesday we saw the charge.If they had told me that I would be charged even if I had gone to have breakfast. I like to pay for what I enjoy. Cost of the room ‚Ç¨ 210.The room had not been sold and I have not taken a place for another customer. I repeat, reserve the room at 9:00 p.m.Alma Pamplona the customer service always has to be exquisite and these details cross out the reliability of the hotel.\n",
      "With a ‚Ç¨ 100 offer we took a superior room that was a real loft. Terrace in the room, cool free bar, bathtub and shower. Unlimited spa access. Modern design and contemporary art collections in the corridors. Upon arrival the staff welcomed us offering Cava (spumante) and water despite we were on trekking clothes (as pilgrims on the way to Santiago). Definitely the best among the spa hotels we found along the way.\n",
      "Delicious food, low quantity and high price, but of quality.The cod showed that it was fresh, undercooked, but very richThe best French toast I've eaten in my life, I would have eaten 4 or 5 ... spectacular!\n",
      "We went to eat at the hotel restaurant. The price is not cheap, but it is worth it until the last euro spent there. The treatment is excellent, the friendliness of the waiter to start, the quality of the tablecloth, the change of covered in each dish, that give you two appetizers before the meal, that prepare you two first half to try both.Very highly recommended. We will return, they have won us\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Very comfortable and exquisite treatment.\n",
      "I was eating at the Alma restaurant, very good. The environment is beautiful\n",
      "The hotel is very nice but no surveillance cameras in the parking lot, our car was hit very hard by a customer and the hotel ignores everything that makes our experience was not enjoyable. A lot of technology and little security, we hope this thought-provoking comment on the hotel and people hitting cars and take flight, can be very serious consequences on the road to those affected.\n",
      "Cozy cafeteria. Small but very nice. With sofas and summer terrace. Isolated from Pamplona, ‚Äã‚Äãso it is very quiet.Somewhat fair portions for the price.\n",
      "Fantastic room and experience for us and this is then a standard room. we will return to explore the city and the surrounding area and also to celebrate my birthday there until May ü§©\n",
      "The quietest hotel in all of Pamplona, ‚Äã‚Äãsurrounded by green gardens, gives you peace as soon as you arrive. In the rooms, large and some with terrace, there is no lack of detail. Of course, with bathrobe and slippers. And also has an excellent kitchen!\n",
      "A fantastic hotel, spectacular views, all very clean. It is an innovative place that conquers by its design.\n",
      "Excellent attention and phenomenal food at the restaurant / Excellent attention and phenomenal food at the restaurant\n",
      "Wedding catering and spectacular food. The environment very nice. Great professionalism in the service\n",
      "Modern, with spacious and comfortable rooms. Friendly staff It is possible to walk to the city center by a pleasant walk.\n",
      "The WORST site where I have worked, and I have worked in HORRIBLE sites. And I am not the only one, in fact a companion denounced them, among other things. As customers I know that you see the good part, but keep these things in mind as well, please. They are exploiters without feelings.\n",
      "Attention of ten, always predisposed and available at reception. The rooms are clean and comfortable. With a beautiful aesthetic and a SPA with the perfect water temperature. A great place to relax. We did not eat at the hotel therefore I have no opinion on it.If I had to put a but: the gym doesn't have much more than 5 machines, fine for fitness but don't expect an exercise room.If I ever return to Pamplona, ‚Äã‚ÄãI will not hesitate to spend a few days at the hotel. Thank you!\n",
      "Impeccable hotel.The people at the reception are all very pleasant, smiling and ready to help you.A special mention for them !!!!The rooms in the restaurant are really good.I recommend 100%.A small downside for the cleaning of the rooms. We left on the excursion at 8 a.m. and returned to the hotel around 3 p.m. The room was not done. We fell asleep and were disturbed twice by the cleaning lady. Finally we got up and used the pool and spa. On our return room not made either. So we ended up with our wet towels and no more toilet paper. Too late to ask when we found out.Other than this little thing our stay was great\n",
      "Spectacular rooms unparalleled views, food of 10 excellent professionals superb attention. Tranquility peace and rest\n",
      "Spectacular Kitchen\n",
      "Brutal in every way ... Dwsde the services and quality of the hospitality and a very attentive staff. Without a doubt one of the best hotels in Pamplona.\n",
      "Good atmosphere, good decoration, friendly staff .. maybe something is missing in the bar pecking menu. rations a little tad\n",
      "A hotel that is very close to the center of Pamplona and surprisingly quiet.The room very comfortable.The restaurant food always to repeat.The shale treatment and the spa although small, enough.\n",
      "Nice and elegant place to spend the night. Access and lighting is what would improve.\n",
      "The hotel is spectacular. I loved its rooms and the location although it is far from the center\n",
      "Excellent restaurant, very good quality price, exquisite treatment, quality products, beautiful site. ‚Ç¨ 35 menu very highly recommended. Desserts especially good. Sure we repeat.\n",
      "I love the decoration, dim lighting and large rooms where you are divinely! In addition the attention is exquisite !!\n",
      "Excellent hotel, staff with little care, the restaurant is excellent also with quality service!The historic center is 5 minutes by taxi (5 ‚Ç¨ ...) ideally placed. The spa will allow you to relax during your trip or like us during a stopover during the Portugal / France trip.\n",
      "My experience was in the restaurant, the treatment very good and the cuisine excellent. Highly recommended All very rich, especially the torrija, of 10.\n",
      "Excellent Hotel with very comfortable rooms, theStaff is very attentive and prepared to meet any need, very good food. The truth that we will definitely stay here again.\n",
      "Exquisite service, quality extraordinary beds, very large rooms, abundant commodities, breakfast in the category standard, quiet and close to the center .. Recommended!\n",
      "I was at a wedding, so I have not seen all the hotel facilities. The hotel is spacious and modern, although it has major flaws, such as the fact that the dining room, which seats about 200 people, does not have bathrooms and you have to walk about 150 meters to the bathroom, which is also too small for that capacity. The lighting, finishes and decoration are correct but could be improved.Food was good and well prepared, but very slow service.\n",
      "A very nice hotel. Descent we like very well and is very tasteful. The spa is already a bit old but meets the needs for a short stay. The food or the kitchen of the restaurant look wonderful and meet high standards.\n",
      "Unbeatable food and room. Absolutely awesome. The best of the whole team, all with a smile and leaving the skin. Thank you\n",
      "Modern, minimalist, quiet hotel. Huge room with shower and bathtub. Very comfortable bed with down duvets. Mini Bar with drinks included. Correct amenities. Maybe I missed a bit more lighting in the room. The views are beautiful. Sauna area and spa pool with very relaxing changing rooms, the water is warm. I was pleasantly surprised that they accept dogs. The correct breakfast, but nothing special for the hotel level, the coffee is capsules. The cafeteria restaurant does not have many food options and is a bit expensive (personal small pizza ‚Ç¨ 12, sandwich ‚Ç¨ 10 ...). The hotel is far from the center walking, it is a little secluded. The staff was friendly.\n",
      "Absolutely outstanding spent two nights here and I am thrilled.Great hotel, perfect location for a 20 minute walk into town and great staff. Gladly again.\n",
      "Hotel well located near the center and in a green area. Its very current design is relaxing and increases volumes.The service is very attentive but without excessNote a very complete breakfast of excellent quality\n",
      "The room is very good but, if I had a jacuzzi, it would be the pump .. I didn't like the spa, the pool is not a jacuzzi, it is a normal pool only and they have 3 jets with very little force. For the price that the spa has is not worth ...\n",
      "It has a difficult access from the street. Once we have entered the enclosure we see a modernist building in dark tones. The interior has spacious rooms overlooking the garden. Countless rooms for events. Access to the rooms is by fingerprint.To test and repeat.\n",
      "An incredible experience! Clearly the perfect hotel for your stay in Pamplona. It is not very central, but it is very well connected and by taxi between ‚Ç¨ 7 and ‚Ç¨ 6. The only detail I've missed is the toilet brush, the perfect rest!\n",
      "Very comfortable and very spacious room\n",
      "A modern hotel that highlights the sympathy and friendliness of its employees\n",
      "We have been very satisfaced. Very quiet place and we have eaten great. To repeat\n",
      "Spectacular!!! Hotel in Iru√±a / Pamplona, ‚Äã‚Äãquality-price according to the treatment of very professional staff and especially Xavi very attentive and explaining each dish and advising the wine. Highly recommended\n",
      "I love why it is a very quiet and cozy place, with the perfect light and a magnificent steak\n",
      "Modern hotel with all kinds of amenities, very attentive service. The fingerprint opening system avoids having to carry a card on top.To put some but, some day at breakfast time was full dining room and we had to wait for a table to be released, while another day enabled another dining room. Breakfast very complete nonetheless.\n",
      "The hotel is in a somewhat isolated location. Underground parking is free for customers. The rooms are very spacious from the smallest and have both a bathtub and a shower. The TV is somewhat old and small. The spa is free to access but is quite limited. The best by far is the restaurant. In any case, a very good site recommended to disconnect a weekend.\n",
      "Modern, spacious rooms, the whole hotel with very good taste, professional staff, nice, helpful etc ...\n",
      "Nice modern hotel. Huge rooms and very good breakfast.A bit far from the center, 20-25 minutes of walk.The spa area is fine but at the end of the afternoon the floor is soaked and slippery, the puddle reaches the gym. They should slow it down from time to time.\n",
      "The hotel is a modern wonder is very good.chapeau, chapeau.You have to go with a good wallet to a hotel of these.\n",
      "A beautiful setting! The service at the top thank you to the staff who leave us at ease! The calm and warm Zen spirit is there! We will go back and we recommend it !!\n",
      "The hotel is beautiful and very quiet, but at the same time it is close to everything you need. The staff very very attentive and polite. Charming place to spend a weekend, do not forget to populate its gastronomic offer, sure you will like it.\n",
      "Impeccable hotel Modern, with very spacious rooms and excellent food. The service is very good and the cleaning also.\n",
      "The workers could not be more polite, kind and friendly. Attentive from the first moment, asking if we did not like something or if we wanted something special. When he finished eating, Pepe passed by the tables saying hello and thanking him, a wonderful, unbeatable attention. The food is spectacular, presentation, taste and variety. Definitely highly recommended. The site is also clean, beautiful and well cared for.\n",
      "A round experienceWe asked for the tasting menu because we wanted to try as much as possible and it shows that it is designed by Pepe because you are really satisfied. The service makes it a complete experience, everyone is very attentive, helpful and correct, they make you feel very comfortable. The tasty food, I have loved trying modern versions of traditional Manchego dishes. we will definitely be back\n",
      "We have chosen the tasting menu and we have really enjoyed it. Each dish is amazing, all very tasty. From the first moment they have treated us wonderfully, very attentive at all times and very friendly. It is certainly a highly recommended site.\n",
      "A spectacular experience. The food a luxury of flavors and traditional. The staff are very friendly, professional and very friendly. And what to say, Gran Pepe, he was charming as he passed by the tables to say hello and chat a bit with us.\n",
      "We went for my birthday to taste the traditional menu. The truth was that it was good, maybe my assessment is lower because I expected something more (TV maybe influenced us) I expected much more intense flavors. The dessert, a kind of nougat souffle, tasted nothing more than egg with sugar. We have had better experiences at other Michelin star menus. Very good service.\n",
      "Without a doubt, a wonderful place to have lunch or dinner. I tried the tasting menu with a friend and it was a delight. Small but very numerous dishes, full of flavor and different nuances. The very attentive waiters explained everything you were going to eat and how you should do it to enjoy the experience even more. We were also able to greet Pepe for what was a unique and most special night.\n",
      "Where do you start? Wow, I had very high expectations with this restaurant, but they have not been high, it has been really wonderful, incredible, unmatched flavors, unique spaces, incredible service, I keep dreaming of those indescribable magical flavors, I keep dreaming of squid ink croquette , I don't know how to describe it. To put a \"but\" is a unique and reduced space at the entrance.\n",
      "From the hand of Pepe Rodr√≠guez and his entire team of professionals, I have enjoyed traditional food all my life, but with a very personal style and fusion, but spectacular. reminding me of my grandmother's stew in a clay pot, my mother's fried tomato and so many and so many flavors from before.I recommend you to enjoy the BOH√çO dishes, I am sure that I will return\n",
      "Great treatment of the staff, very good food with a spectacular flavor. And a visit from Pepe all great. I'll be back soon\n",
      "Very originally presented food. With very intense flavors and very well combined. Great waiter service.\n",
      "A unique experience.Excellent service and attention. Product care to the maximum. Traditional flavors of the land with the right touch of modernity and careful preparation.The place is minimalist, but very cozy, and invites you to a quite relaxed and relaxed atmosphere, without the pomposity of other Michelin-starred establishments.An experience worth enjoying. Totally recommendable.As a final note, I recommend being careful with the pairing, especially if one is prone to getting drunk easily, since they put a glass of wine for each dish, from starters to desserts. When I finished eating, after almost four hours in the restaurant, I couldn't get up from the table because of the slice I had on me. But it was worth it.\n",
      "After having had disastrous experiences in designer food restaurants, I must say that El Boh√≠o has pleasantly surprised us. The dishes are very good, the attention is exquisite and those who asked for a pairing were also very satisfied with the wines that were offered.In our case, when we went on a Saturday, we could only opt for the seasonal menu.The presentation of the dishes was very accurate and informative by the waiters and the plating did not disappoint.We highly recommend this restaurant as it is a complete experience and is not limited to just the food, but also the atmosphere, the layout, compliance with covid measures, and the attention from the staff.\n",
      "Up to expectations, carrying high expectations. Elegance and staging according to the living room and kitchen.They have a short menu and a long menu that can be assumed in price as far as level places are concerned, I asked for the tasting menu (the long one) and it was a total crescendo, the best dish for me, the cocido, heather and its broth. stratospheric level. For me a highly recommended site.\n",
      "Incredible experience.El Boh√≠o is a simple, unpretentious restaurant, located on a road in a building that does not pretend to show off and goes unnoticed as a Michelin star restaurant. From the moment you enter, everything is very familiar and very close: very correct and very polite service. Its cuisine is the perfect symbiosis of traditional Castilian stews with the avant-garde touch and haute cuisine that you expect from a place like this. The duration and quantity of dishes on the tasting menu is very good, in fact, we ended up more than satisfied in terms of quantity. Being able to greet Pepe at the end of the service was the final touch of an incredible experience.\n",
      "What we expected, good service and a dinner that returns you to traditional cuisine adapted to today, thanks to Pepe Rodr√≠guez and his team\n",
      "Exceptional. We have tried the tasting menu and each and every one of the dishes is a real treat. From 10!\n",
      "An experience from the moment you walk through the door. They come with very high expectations and it does not disappoint at all. We have tried the tasting menu with wine pairing, for those who like wines, the occasion cannot be missed. In my case I drank a very rich IPA beer that accompanied me throughout the meal. Of the 14 dishes, I would highlight them all, but if I have to choose, I'll choose the stew, what a flavor !!!It should be noted the excellent treatment of the waitress Virginia, pleasant, smiling, educated and also shows that she likes the work she does. It's a pleasure when the set can stand out as outstanding, but with Virginia's treatment and Pepe's visit we have been amazed. An unforgettable experience. Ahhh and I forgot to mention Pepe's Callos .... Spectacular !!!\n",
      "Great menu, great very professional service and great restaurant atmosphere. Nothing more to add, all great.\n",
      "We could not leave more delighted, what an explosion of flavors, and what to say about the service ... they are great. Thinking about when to return üòç\n",
      "What has been said about the Michelin, nothing to object.We liked their hearty dishes from their traditional menu that in the end without wine comes to about ‚Ç¨ 80 per person.In the middle of the town of Illescas, and it is very popular (full of customers of all ages) undoubtedly due to the popularity of its chef Pepe Rodr√≠guez.We liked to recreate the lentil soup with egg at home.\n",
      "Amazing tasting menu !!We loved it!! Especially the ‚Äúcooked‚Äù and the ‚Äúlentils with blood sausage‚Äù.Super friendly and nice workers. And Pepe there at the foot of the canyon in the kitchen.It has been an unforgettable experience!\n",
      "Excellent service and the food has been an authentic show, all very fine and with a combination of surprising flavors. The service is super attentive and the place has a lot of charm. We will certainly return to enjoy the experience.Pepe, has come to be interested in our opinion and has been charming with us the truth.\n",
      "Incredible ... without hesitation we will repeat. Although the menu is for lunch instead of dinner\n",
      "A spectacular site. With an incredible treatment by the staff, and going on a Sunday we met Pepe and he was charming.The photos are of the dishes on the tasting menu and the truth is that it is impossible to leave hungry. The dishes are quite traditional but with the right touch of innovation and always with a lot of flavor to the product and an exquisite treatment.\n",
      "Spectacular. A unique experience.\n",
      "It is an experience for the senses. Textures and flavors are mixed making a stay in the Boh√≠o completely magical\n",
      "Marvelous!! You eat luxuriously with all kinds of details. They reserved a room for the family and at the end of the service Pepe came to greet us. Very good food.\n",
      "We were visiting the Boh√≠o for the first time and we loved it, the exquisite attention and the very, very rich food, the traditional menu of Pepe dedicated to his mother and which undoubtedly demonstrates the good work of the Chef. clients and spent a few minutes talking with everyone. Charming and without any problem he lent himself to do the rigorous photograph, and I must say that TV does not favor him at all. A pleasure to repeat.\n",
      "Brilliant! The place is nice, at least the room we ate in. We chose the tasting menu with pairing and everything was very good. We really liked everything, but I would highlight the Manchego cheese, the spider crab and scallop stew and the Manchego gazpachos, the three spectacular dishes. The thing that convinced me the least, when it was good, was the chicken, perhaps the thing that surprised me the least. As the only one but, I was not convinced to charge the bread separately, I would include it in the price of the menu even if it is raising the price of it by those 4 euros. Special mention for the pairing, we loved it. Very wide and with very interesting wines, also, very well explained. It is recommended to choose the pairing. We had fun!\n",
      "Michelin star restaurant in Illescas. The attention, at the height of what is expected of a site like this. The seasonal tasting menu, all very tasty. Perhaps the first thing they put to snack on is a bit scarce, since you eat it in one bite, there is no option to savor it a second time. The dishes afterwards, all very tasty. In the end you leave satisfied with the food and the treatment in general. The decoration of the place, well, it is not that it is very careful to detail. White walls and without a touch of glamorous restaurant, quite basic. As soon as you enter you find the huge kitchen, full of people preparing dishes, everything very clean. The price, according to a Michelin star restaurant I suppose, is not cheap. A tasting menu is more or less 100 euros per person.\n",
      "Traditional food (flavored with traditional dishes) with touches of modern cuisine. We ate the seasonal menu at 90 euros per person. All very rich and prepared with care and care. Ideal place to enter the world of new cuisine, as it is suitable for all kinds of tastes. Pepe is very nice and professional. Without a doubt it is a place to repeat. Thanks for everything.\n",
      "As a fan of the Masterchef program and gastronomy, I really wanted to go to Pepe Rodriguez's Boh√≠o.Points in favor: As you walk in, you see Pepe in the kitchen, a sign that despite his fame and television he is still at the foot of the canyon in his restaurant. The place has a very nice reform, modern but respecting the essence of the building that is quite old. It has several bright rooms with large and comfortable tables. The service is impeccable, friendly and attentive at all times.We took the tasting menu: I found the snacks marvelous (special mention for the croquette that almost made me tear a tear), also the tripe dish with caviar, stew broth with cabbage and pring√°, and the pigeon with cannelloni and coconut bechamel . But there were other dishes that did not convince me such as gazpachos, chicken with tomato, smoked sardine with morteruelo broth or shrimp pickle. Desserts are not bad but not up to expectations either. I think the dishes on the menu change several times throughout the year, so it could have been \"bad luck\" or a matter of taste. There is no doubt that the quality of the cuisine is very high.Very extensive wine list and wide price range.When we were going for the last dish, Pepe came to personally greet all the tables. It seemed like a detail to me, and of course, I was excited.Conclusion: very good experience, it is a great restaurant, it is worth traveling to Illescas to know it and I hope to return :)\n",
      "Service 10, quality 10, treatment 10 and a tasting menu that leaves you speechless.Undoubtedly a restaurant at the height of the best, you can not put any but and it makes you want to repeat, being recommended in its entirety ..\n",
      "When you go to El Boh√≠o, from the television show Pepe Rodr√≠guez, you do so with the doubts that he himself projects through his character in the program. Do not be fooled. Behind the kitchen of the restaurant there is a piece of cook. The menu is a set-up of the kitchen of a lifetime. Grandma's lentils, salad, squid with garlic ... but all with a twist. Despite appearances, it is a very technical menu with hardly any ups and downs (perhaps you should take a spin on the sesame dessert, too strong). Fantastic the Pigeon, the morteruelo with lychees or that cooked 2.0. Beyond aesthetics, irreproachable in a crockery that does not clash, we must highlight the flavor. All the dishes are good (it sounds strange to write this in a restaurant with a star, but it is not always the case). The kokotxas with a perfect breading or that emulsion of double chin, mushrooms and peanuts that is perhaps the best dish of all, are good examples of surprising and traditional cuisine at the same time. Let's add to all this an \"old school\" service, where everyone complies, from the sommelier to all the waiters (perhaps the dishes could be explained a little more). Furthermore, an unsurpassed wine list. Impeccable facilities and with all the security measures ... At the end the cook comes out and asks you about everything, showing off your education and knowing how to be ... in short, a meal from which you leave with a smile from ear to ear.\n",
      "All great, Pepe very attentive\n",
      "Pepe Rodr√≠guez's exquisite restaurant. Varied, wide, careful, balanced proposal, spectacular technical work. The attention of the waiters is close, familiar, without empathy. At the end of the service, chef Pepe came out to say hello and thank all the guests for their visit. TV has not diminished his vocation at all and he is one more chef in the team. All dishes within 1 Michelin star restaurants are of very high marks. The tripe, an option that is paid separately, is an absolute 10, they are perfect. There is no improvement possible. Aroma, flavor, texture. Everything is perfect.\n",
      "Intense and quality flavors. Excellent attention. Of the places that are worth returning to.\n",
      "Everything spectacular, from the dishes to the attention received. We will return without hesitation\n",
      "Total experience !!!!! Close atmosphere, excellent service, real flavors and fantasy formats. One last\n",
      "It has been an unforgettable experience. We decided on the traditional menu and it was a success: the dishes are a version of the traditional ones and the explosion of flavor is surprising when you put them in your mouth. The service is exceptional, very attentive and pleasant, always ensuring that your experience is the best possible. It is a detail that they have dishes for children, as delicious as those for adults (I would have eaten that meatball stew that my son had). The place is very cozy with a modern design and traditional details, spacious rooms, very comfortable chairs, spacious tables and well distributed to provide privacy. I'm giving it five stars because I can't give it eleven.\n",
      "Without a doubt, a place to eat a different experience. Traditional dishes with a different touch of modernity ... Nothing is what it seems and surprisingly tastes what it is!\n",
      "Spectacular food attention everything wonderful\n",
      "Impressive tasting menu.Very good, professional and pleasant service.You can see passion for a job well done\n",
      "Round experience üòä\n",
      "Very good work and an excellent presentation with very friendly and attentive staff\n",
      "Being as I am (along with my son) great followers of the Masterchef program since the 1st it was broadcast, we had been wanting to go to lunch or dinner in the Boh√≠o for years, and at last we could see our dream come true thanks to my son-in-law who invited us. .The restaurant more than met our expectations, the dinner (tasting) was fabulous, creative and impossible to stay hungry, the different dishes were like a parade of delicacies in the style of \"The Thousand and One Nights\", each one more and more spectacular and delicious, the final culmination 2 super original desserts worthy of a prince, the attention at the table without blemish ... in the end a delight, as a finale Pepe Rodr√≠guez himself came out to greet us and the emotion and nerves took hold of me, it is super friendly, as shown in the program, simple and friendly. THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!!\n",
      "I have been to several Michelin Star Restaurants and this one is true that it has not been the best, the attention of the service on 3 occasions in the same night has left much to be desired ...The first course was not presented, the second shot out when they left it on the table towards the tablecloth and the cutlery on one occasion he did not leave them, he threw them (and it seems to be a head of the room), not to forget the desire they had to We left and it was 00:30 on a Friday, it is clear that I will not return again ...\n",
      "All exceptional, the service, the timing and the KITCHEN.The tasting menu is very varied and with continuous surprises.Worth it\n",
      "It really is an enjoyment for the palate. You will try all kinds of textures. With the tasting menu you leave very satisfied. Many waiters and all very attentive. You discover new flavor blends that you never imagined they could be. They don't nail you with drinks off the menu. You are in an area separated from other diners and with all sanitary measures. Highly recommended to do so to have a story to tell and one more experience in life.\n",
      "I love gastronomy and my wife could not select a better place to celebrate our anniversary.There are several Michelin star restaurants I've been to and this is one of my favorites. Pepe's cooking made me enjoy and discover new culinary experiences. His humility is appreciated in the dishes.The only downside is that it is difficult to find a space to reserve, although with time there is no problem! I will not only repeat but it becomes a benchmark for me!\n",
      "Delicious everything and impeccable attention, it was my Christmas gift and I had a great time\n",
      "Spectacular. We left enchanted. What we liked the most were the desserts and wines chosen by the sommelier. It is worth going.\n",
      "I loved the place, the exquisite dishes and the attention received.I absolutely recommend visiting it.\n",
      "I had a visit to this restaurant pending for some time and I finally decided to go. They have several rooms (some with more privacy) and with a very pleasant decoration. In addition, the customer service is excellent.They have a full tasting menu and a smaller version of it, but whichever one you choose, I assure you that you will like it and have an unforgettable experience.I was lucky that Pepe Rodr√≠guez himself came out once the service was over to say hello, quite a detail.\n",
      "Place with many decades dedicated to restoration. Exceptional quality, both in the product it offers and in customer service. Pepe's determination to offer the best of the best makes this place a place to visit.\n",
      "An incredible experience. All exquisite with traditional and innovative flavors. The dishes, the presentation and the atmosphere created make you feel the exquisiteness of a good restaurant and the comfort of your home. And as a final dessert, the best thing was Pepe's greeting and being able to meet him and express our gratitude.\n",
      "The treatment of the staff is exquisite, very attentive. Exceptional tasting menu, not a fault. All the delicious dishes and one of the desserts, the frozen coconut sponge with sesame and toffee ... it took me to paradise.We were lucky to see Pepe, at the end of the meal, he shared a few minutes with us .... what to say, he is very nice, simple and professional.It has been a great pleasure ...... we will be back !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n",
      "Very very very rich. We took the long menu and all the dishes had amazing flavors and something special to offer. It is very worth going to celebrate some special occasion, considering that it is a bit far from Madrid and the price is high. A place with a very good atmosphere. The correct service, nothing to highlight, although Pepe did go through the tables at the end of the service.\n",
      "Good food but both the dishes and the service fell below my expectations. Perhaps it is not a correct value for money.\n",
      "We take the tasting menu. All great, but for me, the lentils and cheese ice cream, spectacular. Very polite and professional staff and Pepe a crac\n",
      "Excellent food and treatment. An experience to repeat! And the chef, a sweetheart.\n",
      "The dishes on the seasonal menu are spectacular, full of flavor and great aesthetics, Pepe's visit to our table was appreciated, a great professional.\n",
      "Amazing. We tried the tasting menu, an experience, many dishes and all exquisite.We met Pepe and had a fantastic night. Super nice and attentive waiters. Totally recommendable.\n",
      "Kindness, service, impeccable treatment, spectacular food\n",
      "All great\n",
      "Traditional cuisine, modernized with a lot of sense and without losing essence.The place is very nice after the reform.Great attention.Adequate price.\n",
      "It does not disappoint but it can improve.After the renovation of the restaurant, a tour of all the rooms was expected, but it is understood that due to health measures it may not be possible.On the other hand, it was expected that the tasting menu would be more from La Mancha but the chef takes a risk with some seafood that doesn't have much of a punch; for example tripe with caviar or almond rock with botarga.When serving each dish, it is missed that it is explained about the ingredients, the cooking, the story that inspired the chef to have created this recipe and how to eat it.Very good and successful pairing with each dish.Overall a 6/10.\n",
      "The attention of the staff, excellent, and the food, is an experience of flavors that you have to enjoy\n",
      "We had high expectations and he has far exceeded them.Everything was very tasty and with great taste, and we liked the pairing very much.\n",
      "Exquisite, it is literally the same old food, adapted to today's techniques. Dishes of pure La Mancha tradition with 100% recognizable flavors presented and served in a very original way. The decoration of the restaurant perfectly combines tradition and modernity, always without losing the characteristic touch of La Mancha.\n",
      "Simply spectacular, I was always a bit skeptical about the theme of the star, and the truth is that I have been convinced. Wonderful food, best service\n",
      "An experience of incredible flavors and textures. Great service and excellent quality. You have to live it and savor it. I am amazed. It could not be more delicious.\n",
      "Experience that lives up to expectations. They take care of the details and it is not only flavors and textures, it is also eaten. 100% recommended and although we all hope that the photo is included, they make it natural and pleasant\n",
      "An unforgettable experience\n",
      "Fame and praise are not earned alone, but based on proposals that surprise and highlight. As it has by motto, El Boh√≠o offers the kitchen always seen from the eyes and the most current techniques, resulting in flavors and emotions that are worth experiencing. The autumn menu for me is five stars, with special mention for the fish caldillo. An authentic work of art.\n",
      "I was very excited to get to know the Restaurant and it has exceeded my expectations. Exceptional treatment of the staff, very rich food with surprise in flavor and textures. We agreed that Pepe was there and at the end of the service he came out to greet all the tables. Nice and scathing mor Before we left they asked us if we would like to see the kitchens and there we went. We tried the Autumn menu and the menu of the day, you don't stay hungry, what's more, we didn't have dinner that night.\n",
      "üíØ * üíØ recommended\n",
      "Spectacular.Elaboration, attention, quality, no detail is missing.Obviously, having a job behind like the one there is, a restaurant like that, with that dedication, you have to pay for it.Congratulations !!!\n",
      "Pepe Rodr√≠guez could not fail, but we must not forget the rest of the team just as important !! Special mention to Laura's attention and sympathy. The hut does not disappoint !!! Surely repeat !!\n",
      "All good, for me it met all our expectations. Dishes of ten were many, such as the traditional stew of La pring√° or that of Lentils, spectacular !!! The Mushroom emulsion is a delight !, the half ham croquette one last time and almost everyone like that ... you end up with some desserts that you melt !! The very good service and the very minimalist place, although upon arrival it took me a bit to find the restaurant in this sense.\n",
      "The food and presentation spectacular.The attention of the outstanding staff.The super nice and friendly chef Pepe Rodr√≠guez went around all the tables talking and taking pictures with the customers.\n",
      "A very original place with a mixture of La Mancha flavors with avant-garde cuisine, unbeatable service üëçüëçüëç \n",
      "Year after year, it remains as one of the gastronomic references not only of the province, but of the entire region. The dishes are to enjoy, cutting edge, careful and modern elaborations, but really taste. The reform of the room and the building is spectacular. A must. And with the added value of a well-kept cellar to discover.\n",
      "The restaurant itself is a show. Since you walk through the door (which does not seem like a big deal on the outside) and you find a beautiful kitchen ready to do the dishes. Within the menu we asked for the length and the truth that each dish was unique. Highlight the stew, the cod pie and the desserts! Say that we will try to do our best to return since it is 30 minutes from Madrid. As the only downside that lacked a little \"Pepe\" essence to the dishes.\n",
      "A great, cozy and intimate place, an unforgettable experience and to repeat, I tend to be very delicate when it comes to food but yesterday I was open to try everything, and the truth is that the tasting menu and the treatment received is impressive, then Pepe came very friendly and helpful to ask us about the experience and I can only say that out of 10.\n",
      "Exceptional service, Pepe and his entire team a 10 and the food little to say, what we expected, delicious\n",
      "Very good experience and in line with expectations: good service and professionalism, traditional menu, exquisite and well-measured tasting plan, without a feeling of heaviness at the end.Highly recommended.The price is high, but in accordance with the attention displayed by all the staff and the installation of the premises.I said, highly recommended for a good dinner and evening.\n",
      "Incredible experience. We ordered the seasonal menu. The quality and taste of the dishes has been much more than we expected, and we already had high expectations. Servings size very good, we were satiated. The room service is exquisite, and very friendly. To repeat!\n",
      "I think the best that can be said about a place where you go with so many expectations is that, far from disappointing, we were wonderfully surprised. From the moment we entered until we left, we did it with a smile. The food is incredible, the staff are charming and Pepe came out to greet with the best of smiles (even if it was only seen in his eyes with the mask üòÖ) and like so many others we went largely for him. As I say, we can only say good things about El Bohio.\n",
      "Very cozy place and an excellent treatment. We took the tasting menu and the exquisite dishes, very attentive staff.\n",
      "A wonderful experience.It is like visiting a museum but related to gastronomy.Pepe Rodr√≠guez a wonderful person and close to clients.The unbeatable treatment and, especially, Alberto.\n",
      "Cheap, it is not, but of course, the gastronomic experience is spectacular ...You can't expect it to be cheap when you eat very well and besides, I who eat have come out \"full\" based on trying 12-14 dishes (obviously they are 2 tablespoons of each, but it fills you up ...).For my part, \"Totally recommended ...\"\n",
      "The always elaborate kitchen like never before. An explosion of flavor in your mouth. Highly recommended if you like to eat well and live happily. Thank you very much Pepe and your team for that moment you made us go through. See you soon!\n",
      "You leave hungry because they don't eat. One expects more from the spirit of the land, which is to eat abundantly. The Michelin star has spoiled a good restaurant, like so many other times.\n",
      "We celebrated our second baptism there (open-air cocktail) and everything was just as perfect as the first. It is always a good choice.\n",
      "How could it be less, all the dishes were spectacular. The service from the moment you enter super attentive and very friendly, Pepe Rodr√≠guez was missing from the tables, but he was recording.We will definitely be back.\n",
      "Quiet place, excellent food and exquisite treatment.\n",
      "My wife and I went to dinner last Friday 10/1/21. After our stay in Aponiente with 3 Michelin stars, the bar was very high. I have to say that, although there are obvious differences, the culinary experience is up to par. Traditional dishes with avant-garde elaborations. Our choice was the seasonal menu. I highlight the cold apple and cucumber soup and the old clothes.Message to Pepe. You cannot deny that you are the son of your parents ... because of the photo in the hall upstairs.\n",
      "Impressive, it seems incredible that you can eat so well, enjoying each dish, with an attentive staff, very majestic all and a chef with a well-deserved fame. We will be back for sure.\n",
      "An experience of new flavors and textures. Everything was delicious although the last dishes were no longer available. At the end of the dinner Pepe came out and greeted us, it was quite a detail. I recommend it.\n",
      "The first time I came was on Thursday night, there were not many people with the mentality of giving it a try. I ordered a medium set meal. The portion feels just not very supportive. The dishes are very creative. The taste is excellent. The waiting time between fast dishes and dishes is shortThe second time I came here was Friday night. We arrived earlier and the restaurant was full when we left. This time I ordered a large set meal. The number of dishes is naturally higher than the medium one, but the serving size of each dish is not reduced, so it is super for girls to finish the meal. It feels a bit uncomfortable to support the creation of dishes and the medium set menu does not repeat. Individual dishes are not very suitable for individual Chinese tastes. The set menu is still very good. Although it is a weekend, the service time has not been extended. I was fortunate to see Pepe himself and said hello on TV It feels very serious but the real person is very kindIt‚Äôs the best one in Madrid and the surrounding Michelin star. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not very convenient without a car.\n",
      "Very rich, all very beautiful and very good service.\n",
      "All delicious, we ordered the tasting menu, 17 dishes, brutal, we rolled out. Tremendous flavor, textures, waiters and room staff very attentive and friendly, the girl at the entrance bad and Pepe a love. We will be back!\n",
      "From another level! We had a small mishap that was solved right away and Pepe went up to apologize in person, really amazing, an experience for the senses. More than a dinner is a show!\n",
      "Great food, combines the traditional flavor presented in a spectacular way, the service of 10, and Pepe, brutal ... Thanks for everything Pepe, without a doubt, we will return again (Andrea's friends üòç\n",
      "We have eaten the tasting menu and I can say that in general everything was very good, with several surprises in the mouth. It is worth it and it is highly recommended. Pepe callus insurmountable as a complement.\n",
      "Marvelous. The attention of the waiters and waitresses great. All very well explained and very friendly\n",
      "We had dinner on Saturday at the tavern. An interesting menu, different from the restaurant. We ordered grilled leeks with roncal cheese and green oil, creamy croquettes, and they were really creamy, and really good cheek cannelloni. For dessert a cheese flan. With drink and coffee, a very affordable price of 70 euros for three people. Not expensive for the quality. Tavern atmosphere, young and friendly staff. To repeat without hesitation on another visit to a town that is very worthwhile. It has left us wanting to repeat more calmly and for longer.\n",
      "We have visited Pedraza with our dog and we were looking for a terrace to eat. We ended up here by chance and they have treated us so well, so kindly and we have eaten so well that I did not want to end the day without leaving a review. It has started to rain and they have offered us a table at the entrance of the house to be able to be with the dog. Exquisite food. And we have found out who is behind when we were almost finished, from a relative to whom we have told where we were. It is not a cheap place, but it has been worth the visit.\n",
      "We ate on the terrace. The food and the surroundings, exquisite. The treatment of one of the waiters (with very curly hair) displeased us quite a bit. He had a very curt way of answering. He was wrong when it came to bringing us the beer (we asked for it with lemon), and when we told him, he took it from the table and drank it in front of us, in the cashier area.\n",
      "In a splendid location, a pleasant and professional treatment. As for food, it is quality cuisine. I recommend some leeks full of flavor and the carrilera cannelloni.\n",
      "Charming place in the very square of Pedraza. Impeccable attention as well as its dishes, prepared and cared for in detail. Without a doubt, a place where you can enjoy good gastronomy in a unique and beautiful environment\n",
      "Exquisite food and service. It has a beautiful terrace that overlooks the main square of Pedraza. The tavern inside is small and the tables somewhat uncomfortable. Highly recommended if you pass through Pedraza.\n",
      "Exquisite food, lovely staff, they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.They helped me with my. mother in a wheelchair.Lovely Samanta, came out to greet the diners who were outside.\n",
      "I did not like it. Very expensive for the content of the tasting menu. Very rare and not good dishes. Only the meat and one of the desserts is saved. The handful of peas were hard, the veal carpaccio tasted very odd. Much name for so little quality. In short, a joke.\n",
      "Samantha Menu. Spectacular the treatment and the food, all with a lot of flavor. A highly recommended place located in the heart of Pedraza. We will be back.\n",
      "A very nice place ... made with great taste .... very nice waiters ... we had a drink and we were very comfortable\n",
      "We have eaten at home tavern.Positives: the staff have been lovely and very attentive. The food is very rich and the environment is decorated rustic without pretensions in the super nice Castilian style.Negatives: the chairs are not very comfortable and the hall stools are not either. On the other hand, they are not prepared for children, there are no high chairs, no changing table, or wastebasket to throw away the diaper. I see that the aesthetic concept deprives; but aesthetics should not be at odds with functionality.\n",
      "Expensive restaurant and average quality for the price, service of young people with good intentions but not very professional, tavern chairs and table very uncomfortable. I was very negatively surprised by the arrogant attitude of the owner Samantha Vallejo Najera towards her employees, on several occasions without her believing that they were seeing her, she had two moments of very rudeness, haughtiness and a very bad gesture towards an employee, the treatment was regrettable.He entered the terrace with an air of grandeur, but with very little education towards his employees.I do not recommend the site, for me a site more of posture than of quality as it sells.\n",
      "Good restaurant and very good service. The staff of 10. The rosc√≥n menu terrific. The living room is very quiet.\n",
      "Going to Pedraza and not knowing the tavern is a sin.Absolutely recommended. Very VERY friendly and professional. They treat you with real affection.We went without a reservation but we were very well eaten with the Tavern menu.Thank you.\n",
      "A pity, as a charming place it is only limited to providing meals and not serving people who want to have a coffee. Of course, they invited us to leave politely.In the bar opposite \"El porch\" they treated us very kindly\n",
      "Regular. The bread could be more and of a higher quality. The beer is not cold enough and it cannot take that long to serve and the tall waiter can better respond to my request. Come on, who can be more sympathetic.\n",
      "First time we visited the place in a fantastic environment. The staff VERY ATTENTIVE, and the food with flavor and very successful. Do not expect a restaurant with Michelin stars, it is a place to feel and move to what Pedraza is and its history. A pity not to meet Samantha and congratulations!\n",
      "The food was delicious, the croquettes very creamy and the flan spectacular. In addition, the attention is unbeatable. We would return without hesitation.\n",
      "Spectacular food but very poor organization. We had the reservation 15 days before and at no time did they tell us that we would eat on the terrace and in the sun since we were 8 people. The worst thing was going into the bathroom and seeing an empty dining room. A little disappointed the truth\n",
      "It's worth it. Very nice decoration, they treat you great and you eat very well.\n",
      "We had dinner in the restaurant, by phone when making the reservation for dinner they told us that the tasting menu was a full table, that when going with children, they could order from the menu if they wanted, however when we arrived they told us that the tasting menu It is only served at noon, on that side we did not like the lack of coordination in the information. The food was all of good quality, it was all very tasty. The portions are on the small side. The place is cozy and tastefully decorated. The service was friendly and everything correct. In the restaurant I missed the tablecloth, I understand that not in the concept of a tavern, but in the restaurant. Samantha was passing by the tables and she was very nice, we went with children and they loved meeting her, she was great. Recommended in general.\n",
      "They met expectations, fabulous treatment and exquisite food. After having seen the previous reviews, we were wondering if we were going to the right place to spend a Sunday after-dinner ...Conclusion I draw:\"There are people there.\"Congratulations to the Casa Taberna team!\n",
      "Highly recommended, we have loved everything: food, place and staff.\n",
      "We ate very well and the place is pleasant (although we were quite cold), with good value for money; With the expectation of being a MasterChef play, not that it disappointed us but it wasn't extraordinary either. What we liked the most were the low-temperature eggs with truffle and Boletus, and the caramelized Paquillo peppers\n",
      "We had a drink in the tavern, and we stayed for about an hour, but we decided to go without having dinner at all because the seats, some boards with thin cushions, and the table, made of old wood, very very low (and by the way, not very clean) , left us the fatal back, and we no longer wanted to order dinner. Good food should be accompanied by minimal comfort.\n",
      "We have loved both the treatment, the atmosphere and especially the dishes. The egg at low temperature with boletus and spectacular truffle. Also the steak with baked piquillo peppers. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Typical place of Pedraza. The food is very elaborate and exquisite. If you pass nearby, it is worth visiting. The treatment of 10, very friendly and attentive.\n",
      "Perfect location, the building is located in the Plaza Mayor of Pedraza, very well cared for and in keeping with the style of the place. The service is good, fast and efficient. The tavern menu is not very extensive but you can go on several occasions and try different dishes. The food does not detract from the expectations, good quality, good preparation and presentation. To put some but I would say that the chairs on the terrace are not comfortable, perhaps with the idea that one does not accommodate very long after-hours. And on the other hand I would contribute that they indicate with signs the reserved tables since they continually have to lift people from tables because they are already reserved. It's worth going and getting to dessert!\n",
      "All very good, excellent food, very high-priced wine, they charge a lot for the wine and a waitress who offered us up to 8 times coca cola, good attention from Fran our countryman and the girl at the door very nice, I don't like that Take away the dishes without finishing eating, the spectacular food, the dishes very well prepared and the steak very well grilled, the chocolate cake the best I have ever had\n",
      "Insuperable!! Like at home!!Equipped Casa Taberna.We hope to return soon ...\n",
      "Delighted with the treatment, very good food, special review for the leeks and the ribeye\n",
      "Great place, if you like grilled I recommend going to the tavern and ordering the leeks and the cutlet.\n",
      "We have eaten very well in the restaurant, good products on the Samatha menu and delicious desserts\n",
      "We were 5 people and we all loved it. Delicious cuisine and professional service. We will be back. Highly recommended\n",
      "I was looking for a place at the height of our illusion. We celebrated a very special date as a family. I decided to book despite only knowing the place from these reviews ... Result: stars are missing to evaluate. Idyllic place. The really good food, in quantity and quality, shows that they know what they are doing. The unbeatable treatment, from the first to the last of the team. Samantha, appeared by surprise and appreciated very much. Special mention to Shuang, involved without knowing us so that everything would go well. Out of 5 a 10. Thank you all.\n",
      "A 10 for attention, service and gastronomy. Samanta's kindness and spontaneity mean that the experience cannot be valued with less than 10. Special mention to Shuan, who has been an accomplice of our experience and a gift to our daughter.\n",
      "Good attention and very well prepared food.The elaboration has a price but without abuse. Abusive prices by far.\n",
      "Fabulous!!! Great food, and brutal Ale service. Highly recommended\n",
      "Nondescript place, with little taste in the decoration of the tables, expensive and bland food, we asked for the second cutlet 55 euros it was cold, I say it and they bring me the same one heated in the oven, no, that is not received, I You bring a new one, not the same overheated one. the interior restaurant was empty, it doesn't surprise me, bland, and with a menu of ‚Ç¨ 75 and ‚Ç¨ 65. expensive for the standard of pedraza. I imagine that's why there was no table problem .stone is a wonderful place, but of course home tavern I will not return\n",
      "Poor quality-quantity-price ratio at least in the Restaurant section.If you go with children under 14 they invite you to stay in the tavern and not in the restaurant where they serve the tasting menu.In my case, I went with a 4-year-old girl and they accepted my reservation after asking if parents with children under 14 were not entitled to enjoy the tasting menu even if the children did not bother.The score is low not for this but for aspects related to the menu and the service.For children they force you to a children's menu that is not indicated in any menu. The price of the children's menu is ‚Ç¨ 30.The menu consists of 1 serving of 8 croquettes, which were very rich and creamy, 1 plate of chicken finger and French fries, 1 yogurt cream. It seems a bit expensive doesn't it?The Samantha tasting menu of taste and quality very good but very poor in quantity. The surprising thing is that the dishes are shared among the diners. That is not indicated anywhere. Why force sharing? Each diner should receive their plate. Imagine that the diners are not family. The best comes with the ribeye, for the price of the menu it should be one per person. But they come and ask who wants the bone? And the meat to be distributed for 2. But there was a table of 5 and they brought him pieces already cut.The very rich desserts, although the same, all putting the spoon in the same plate.The bathrooms not very clean and the service with little experience.I will not repeat.\n",
      "Not very extensive menu but with good products and delicious dishes. Reasonable value for money. Good attention, especially from Covadonga. Very kind and friendly Samantha has come to greet customers. We will return later to try the tasting menu.\n",
      "It was a place that we wanted to know since it opened but due to the state of alarm we could not come from Madrid, the town we already knew and it is one of the most charming towns in Spain but it was already worth coming to spend the day in Pedraza Now it is worth twice as much every kilometer you do from Madrid. A beautiful restaurant with a simple but exquisite tavern menu. In addition, we agreed with Samantha and she was very attentive and close, asking us how everything was. A place to repeat over and over again !!!\n",
      "A pity, the ribeye was salty and we missed a tablecloth, a great disappointment.\n",
      "We have dined on the terrace, a spectacular place, we decided on tapas / portions and we were not wrong. On the other hand, we received a visit from Samantha who greeted all the tables one by one and could not be more sympathetic. By surprise his son appeared there are no words, a crack. And what to say about the waiter with the \"curls\" well, nothing bad, nice, friendly and very very professional. We will be back.\n",
      "Close and pleasant treatment, simple but good and tasty food. Spectacular location.\n",
      "Charming restaurant, good service and delicious food. We took the Rosc√≥n menu and everything was exquisite, except for my taste, one of the desserts, the burnt milk ice cream. Without a doubt, I will repeat, I loved it. Samantha showed up and waved around the tables and was very nice and personable. Congratulations!\n",
      "Correct treatment but they still have a world to improve. Average food, I expected something else, for what it is I find it excessively expensive since it is a normal restaurant and nothing more. Samantha being a demanding chef in her restaurant does not reflect it.\n",
      "The truth is that it was a bittersweet experience, since the place is beautiful, and Samantha's menu, the truth is that it is spectacular, since you do not know which dish to choose, the experience with it. Service started well, but when we arrived at 4:40 p.m., the girl who attended us was in a hurry to leave, because when serving the infusions, she did not put the sugar, and after 5 minutes she went to the room I asked her, After bringing the bill, the charge said thank you and left quickly, he did not even offer us a few shots, as at the previous table, I did not understand it, since in the reservation he put the time to enjoy the menu was 15 : 30-17: 15, and on top of that we arrive before time, the only thing I ask is that if they close earlier, on the web they do not give the option to book until 4:00 p.m., I think it is not asking much that they treat us well until the end of the service, not only at the beginning and then as they were already picking up, come quickly and run, go away, I do not know if we will return, I hope this comment helps you improve this detail\n",
      "A shame, really. It has only been a couple of canes and Fanta on the terrace, but a 20 minute wait for the change, which we have had to claim three times. Offensive that the waiter doubts what was delivered, he wanted to keep the change for his face\n",
      "The service was very attentive and friendly at all times, the cuisine is simply spectacular !! It is the perfect place to round off a day in the Sierra Segoviana\n",
      "Phenomenon!!!We were eating on the terrace of the tavern. Quality food, very well cooked and delicious. We loved the leeks, the cannelloni, the salad, the ear, the creamy croquettes and the desserts. The bread of 10.Very good treatment of the staff, we have to be grateful that we inadvertently gave extra cash and told them to keep the returns. When they realized that \"the tip\" was very large, they informed us that we had made a mistake and that they would return that amount. Indeed we had left 50 euros and a bit more. We were only accepted the remaining coins. Quite a detail, some would have surely kept quiet.\n",
      "Magnificent experience. I have loved the tavern house, all its menu and the careful service. Special mention of the leeks and of course, the chop. We will repeat\n",
      "I can't speak about the restaurant because we visited the place in the early afternoon; but if we had the pastry because we were going with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa coffee and they offered us something sweet.Both are very rich; prices within the logic of the site and the local so for the next time I hope soon; we also signed up for the restaurant.By the way the location of the local idyllic\n",
      "We went to have a snack at the tavern, there was only one option left on the menu since the kitchen was closed (when they are supposed to have a snack menu). I am celiac, they had nothing for me, the truth is that it disappointed me a lot. The only good thing was the waiters who were very friendly.\n",
      "The location is unbeatable, but we were disappointed by the attention. One minute after serving us the second drink they told us that, although we were sure to be very comfortable and that they were sorry, we had to leave before 15 minutes because the table was reserved (and they had just realized it). We all have errors, but we did not find a way to solve it. We asked the waiter that, in that case, we didn't mind changing tables, or even removing the drink that had just been served. He left and a girl came back to tell us that we could stay longer. Good, but if we didn't get to say anything we would have had to drink the glass against the clock.\n",
      "At 19:30 you can no longer have a beer because the tables are reserved for dinners ... Anyway, an experience reserved for the chosen ones. Luckily there are many other places in Pedraza, very good and without so many pretenses\n",
      "There is no air conditioning. We had a reservation at 2:00 p.m. and they didn't give us it until 2:30 because it was busy. The table with an uncomfortable running bench. They offer free parking and it refers to the nearby streets. The menu does not have options only meat (ribeye). The dire attention. If you can, better not go.\n",
      "The food is correct without more, but what is in a tavern as a main course there are few options.We were on the terrace at a table that was quite fair for 6 people and sat in some small and uncomfortable folding chairs and suffering that they did not break since, like the table, they moved a lot.\n",
      "A restaurant that has to consult the board of directors in order to open a Ribera del Duero flat for you, goes bust on two newscasts.Inconceivable in a restaurant with high expectations. We were going to order a meal for 8 and we do not return and we are neighbors.\n",
      "We have eaten well, all delicious, the meat, the piquillo peppers, the chistorras, the leeks, good wines and the guy who served us (he was from Seville) was super friendly and a good professional.\n",
      "We were encouraged to book on the recommendation of friends and the experience certainly met expectations. The place has a lot of charm, the food is fantastic and its young team transmits all the enthusiasm put into this project. The deal is very close and the chop ... God the chop! We will definitely be back.\n",
      "Unbeatable location. Charming place where you can enjoy the attention and the food. The ribeye and garnish we ordered was exquisite. A ten for the ham croquette and the spectacular anchovy.Highly recommended ü§©\n",
      "We were eating on Saturday and the truth is that the experience was regular. In the first place, it took them a long time to take orders for the drinks, and with the heat that was it was quite unpleasant, thank goodness we had a bottle of water in our bag, also the service is especially slow, in bringing the drink and food. Even the girl at the door saw us several times and apologized for the delay. We ordered starters croquettes and gazpacho, which I have to say was very very good, to object, some croquette had a larger piece of ham than the bill and with nerve which made it impossible to eat it. Second we asked for the cutlet to share and we indicated that we did not want it to be raw, not to bleed, and they brought us an overcooked cutlet, it was hard and past the point we asked for. In my opinion they should have sinned to leave it more raw since it would have a solution, but in our case, we had to eat it like that. The flavor was very good, the only downside is that it was very hard. The waiters and waitresses who served us were charming at all times and the setting is beautiful, but I think they need to improve the service a bit.\n",
      "We were in the La Taberna part, and it was exceptional. The quality of the dishes is spectacular, with an incredible fusion of flavors. The price is not far-fetched considering the product and the service. 100% recommended being in Pedraza, it is one more experience of the visit.\n",
      "The truth is that a very bad experience, especially the attention of the waiter, a long wait to be able to order something to eat before sitting down, we asked him if we could eat inside and he said no, it was all reserved but seconds later he approaches the table that He was by our side and tells him that if they prefer to sit inside, the truth is, expensive food and nothing special for those prices, only the location is worth it\n",
      "Restaurant according to expectations, both in food and service, delicious food, and special mention to our waiter Alejandro solved all our doubts and advised us very well.Quality / price ratio 10\n",
      "Quite deficient attention, very uncomfortable chairs and table. We asked for a terrace because we had a puppy and at no time did they offer us any other option than the terrace. The food is not worth what it costs. I must say that we had very high expectations for being from Samanta from Masterchef‚Ä¶ clearly disappointed.\n",
      "A very nice site. Everything was very good. In any case, Alejando is always attentive to advise you. An example of the dessert we ate. Flan Brul√©.\n",
      "All very good and very friendly staff\n",
      "The restaurant is spectacular and beautiful and nobody takes that away from it, we just went to have a coffee but the attention left a lot to be desired, they took a long time to attend us and we even had to call ourselves to finally do it and it is not that they were exactly friendly. ..\n",
      "I will not repeat yet with invitation.And I know a lot about this and I am the 1 time that I put my opinion, regarding each offer and each one can choose. But it hurts me that being someone who is dedicated to preparing people and judging others, he does not know CV and what he does wrong at home.\n",
      "Great food\n",
      "Nice place ... takes me back to my childhood\n",
      "A beautiful place with outstanding service and food of 10. Quality product. I will repeat without a doubt. An essential in Pedraza !!\n",
      "Amazing people who give this site 5 stars. Scarce letter, and more expensive impossible. ‚Ç¨ 11 for 4 croquettes, ‚Ç¨ 3 for a gilda with 3 olives, half an anchovy and half a chilli, ‚Ç¨ 9 for a txistorra, ‚Ç¨ 16 for a tiny ear portion, ‚Ç¨ 9 for a Russian salad portion.They do not have allergens menu and you ask the waiter and he is not able to tell you the allergens that each product on the menu carries.Surely quality, quantity, price the worst restaurant I have ever visited in my life, an armed robbery. The people who comment here in the reviews are amazed at the site, they have little criteria or few restaurants have visited because it goes fabric\n",
      "We have just eaten in this restaurant and the experience has been 10, exquisite attention and delicious food, they even had a pleasant detail without having to, without a doubt we will return because we are left with the desire to see Samantha, my daughter is a great fan of her and Masterchef and we were very sorry not to be able to see her and have a photo taken with her.\n",
      "Very good everything, very professional and photo with Collate thank you.\n",
      "A very charming place ... We also met Fran from MasterChef.\n",
      "Spectacular, the food, the treatment, everything. Samanta has gone table by table asking how everyone is. The professional supreme camaraderie. I give it a 10\n",
      "Spectacular food, and incredible attention, to repeat without a doubt.\n",
      "We arrived on Friday 8 in the afternoon, we ordered a beer and something to eat and they told us that they did not have anything that everything was finished in the kitchen !!! üôÑ Of course the terrace and the spectacular sites, the service leaves much to be desired, the poor waiters do not hear when you call them with so much ear, and I posture! After drinking the beer we begged him for some sad olives and we were lucky ..\n",
      "Thanks to the Casa Taberna team for the treatment received.The gastronomic offer cannot be better.Thanks to Samantha for making our daughter have a super happy day.Also thank Shuan for being an accomplice in this great surprise.All the bestNatalie\n",
      "A very highly recommended place !!!It is Nature, charm, special people, 10/10 Gastronomy.The team is young and very professional !!\n",
      "The waiter was not very friendly and they took a long time to serve us.The gazpacho was very acidic, the leeks for the price they had tasted like burned in general, the best thing about the place is its location. I would not recommend it\n",
      "The site is great. In the heart of the main square of Pedraza, it is an old house renovated with great taste, in which they have managed to keep the old dyes with a modern touch. The staff is super friendly, you feel better than at home; all smiles and good attentions. The food is very tasty; good product and well treated. I recommend the gazpacho, delicious, with a very fine texture and very digestive. The baby peas are delicious and very fine too. The cheek cannelloni is very tasty, and it brings a lot of it. We are looking forward to returning.\n",
      "Delicious tapas but the best, the desserts. The brioche and the chocolate cake are spectacular !!!\n",
      "Good cuisine in a beautiful town.We tried the menu of the Tavern (they also have a restaurant).The best: grilled leeks and cheek cannelloni. Both amazing. For two it falls short to ask for just that. We also ordered the ear a la brava and a dessert each. With this we are fine. Next time we will surely order the ribeye and leeks.Of the desserts, I recommend the Brioche and I do not recommend Samantha's cake at all. There are 3 chocolates with some ice cream that is scarce and does not taste like anything special.Price is good. It is not cheap but not expensive either. Two people around ‚Ç¨ 80.\n",
      "Super nice people and attentive, surprised since it is from the jury of Masterchef samantha\n",
      "We had a snacking dinner on the terrace .. Enjoying the surroundings at dusk we encouraged ourselves with the chop accompanied with Marques de Riscal wine ... perfect We will repeat fixed.\n",
      "The service a bit slow, the price-quantity ratio for me is not balanced. The cutlet was good but honestly I would have eaten in another restaurant in town since they were more affordable and even more beautiful.In addition, the bathrooms were not in line with the quality that the restaurant claims to have.\n",
      "The one who seemed to be the manager took good care of us, but the one who seemed the owner was very unpleasant. The rest of the employees are neither there nor expected\n",
      "Exquisite dishes and very good service.\n",
      "All perfect. Very friendly staff and great food\n",
      "A cozy place, exquisite treatment by the young and attentive staff, and delicious food make Casa Taberna a must. Congratulations!\n",
      "Upon arrival we were greeted with a \"welcome home\" and that's true! They made me feel at home, an attentive service and a meal that brings tears to my eyes when I remember the taste of all the dishes. Congratulations! I'll be back for sure!\n",
      "Cozy, with a very complete tasting menu, you can choose between a tavern and a restaurant. I liked it, Pedraza is a great town, we will return.\n",
      "A very cozy place with an excellent treatment with a good wine list and good products\n",
      "Expensive and we almost have to apologize to order 1 aquarius.\n",
      "Not even in your own home will they treat you better. Meticulous care in details, close treatment, quality in a charming place. We will come back for sure\n",
      "Unbeatable quality / price, a very interesting gastronomic experience if the environment in which it is received is also taken into account. A good option for any Sunday.\n",
      "Simply spectacular.......\n",
      "Great food, unbeatable treatment and the owner is very friendly. We will be back\n",
      "Great breadth between the restaurant tables, the table for four spacious, phenomenal treatment, value for money of 10.\n",
      "We were disappointed in their cooking. Very expensive and the dishes without much quality. I do not recommend it\n",
      "We were having a coffee and the tavern is very nice, cozy and a very rustic atmosphere. We met Samantha who is charming and very friendly. We will return to taste the dishes on your menu.\n",
      "We entered by chance and the truth was that it was a success. Food and exquisite treatment, if we return to these lands we will repeat for sure. Continue like this.\n",
      "We arrive around seven in the afternoon, we ask for a table for dinner, they tell us that everything is complete, restaurant and tavern. We ask again and they offer us the tables in the arcade.Dinner well, average of unpretentious tasca (half portions expensive dinner ‚Ç¨ 100)The moral when we leave at a quarter to ten, the dining room empty and the tavern the same. Very indignant, when at first it lacks seriousness little more can be expectedAnother thing that I had not noticed:The administrator of the company only answers the good or very good reviews and does so with a super simple template, we hope this also works for freeAnd that you have excuses and show that you know the place with the complaints.\n",
      "Very cozy place, very tastefully decorated. Excellent treatment of the staff and very attentive to all the details. We ate in the restaurant, the menu was great to highlight the meat that was spectacular and the delicious croquettes. Definitely a place where we will return.\n",
      "Very different prices and portions. Slow in service. Uncomfortable chairs. It's not worth coming\n",
      "Beautiful tavern located in the Plaza Mayor of Pedraza (beautiful town in the northern sierra de guardarama). It has a simple but very entertaining menu. It is new (3 months) for what I do not know will be changed seasonally. We tried the gildas, ham, peas, cheek gutters, chop (entrecote) and for dessert the yogurt, the chocolate cake and the cheese custard.Everything was great! And top marks for the desserts, for that alone it's worth going back.\n",
      "A house with a lot of charm, a cozy atmosphere, very friendly and attentive staff and delicious food. I definitely recommend it\n",
      "It has been a wonderful experience! From reservation to dessert. An unbeatable treatment, a delicious meal (100% grilled leek recommended), Samantha super close, the waiters and the pleasant and friendly cooks ... I have felt at home! We will be back!\n",
      "A super nice experience !! First class attention always looking out for you, the food is very good, the spectacular leeks and what to say about the ribeye ü§§\n",
      "Charming place. Worked and elaborated food, especially leeks and meat (for me, obligatory). Very familiar and close to professional treatment.Highly recommended\n",
      "An incredible experience.We visited the town of Pedraza on a family trip and decided to try the restaurant.When we arrived and given that it was a very good day, we stayed a while on the terrace enjoying the sun and the views. We were very surprised that Samantha herself happened a couple of times to worry that everything was correct and that we were enjoying ourselves.A while later we went to the part of the dining room where we asked for a Samantha menu for each one, and although it was all incredibly good, I am forced to highlight the steak, which was simply at another level, one of the best if not the best that we have never eaten.We were also surprised by the super close and warm treatment of all the staff, we really stayed more with the feeling of enjoying a meal with friends than of being in a restaurant.In short, delighted with the experience, totally recommended.\n",
      "The food is a 10, we ordered several starters and they were all delicious and the grilled cutlet was üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºGreat quality / price ratioWe met Samanta and she was chatting with us and with all the diners.The treatment of the waiters was excellentThe town is very pretty.We will repeat and surely it is soon\n",
      "Excellent service and product quality. A 10! Recommended 100%\n",
      "Good treatment, although the price is a bit high (we have eaten in the tavern part, not in the restaurant).\n",
      "Some details such as the waiter arriving with the wines served from the bar to the table, I do not seem professional for the level they want to give. Quality - price of the products as well as the quantity, exorbitant. Especially the potato omelette that we asked for, especially little curd, the amount of the same ridiculous, they came out tasteless and well cooked and the broths very successful in flavor, but very high the price for the quantity. The experience with the only waiter there was, very well dressed for the occasion but sparing in words. We were surprised by the arrival of Samantha very close to the clients, greeting us all. To sum up, and from our previous experience in restoration, I would not recommend this site at this time until both the treatment, quality and quantity are in line with the initial project.\n",
      "I'm sorry but I haven't had a good experience. Today the heating was broken (they told us that) and in the living room on the right, next to the window, it was very cold (we have put on our coat). Between the starter and the main (a good steak), we had to wait half an hour of the clock until we remembered it and, unfortunately, the meat was out of temper inside. Besides, I found it expensive.The place is beautiful and well decorated.\n",
      "Fatal. Exaggerated prices. We ordered two crepes and they charged us ‚Ç¨ 16, and on top of it small in size and with a lot of fat. Certainly not recommended. Very expensive.\n",
      "Very good service, good quality, good price.\n",
      "A scam. The very rare and super expensive tapas: ‚Ç¨ 9 for four pieces of chistorra.\n",
      "Nice and fantastic service üëç\n",
      "Attention, treatment, kindness, details, food, everything has been phenomenal\n",
      "This is the chronicle of a disenchantment. A restaurant with a wonderful location, in a majestic 16th century building, with an address - Samantha's - that has all the marketing done. He has everything to succeed, except the team.- First meet. 15:35 in the afternoon we decided to go for a coffee with some cake to open our mouths in Pedraza (we had already eaten). Although there were free tables in the plaza, we were told to wait for a couple of customers to be charged. I thought the free tables would be reserved. 20 minutes later, I asked one of the waitresses if we could sit at those free tables now and she said 'sure'.Free tables, no one at the wheel and us waiting. It was a bad omen that was confirmed: very slow service, very inexperienced and unprofessional. Around 4:10 they take us notice. They tell us they have sponge cake or lemon tart. We ordered the lemon and the coffees.At the next table, new customers arrive and they are told that there is chocolate cake, brioche, sponge cake, lemon cake, etc. Too bad. 2 coffees, 1 milk and two lemon cakes (quite sour) 20 euros and an eternal wait to be charged. It also happened at other tables, waiting and slow.- Second meeting. Light dinner. We don't eat meat, and the little girl wasn't hungry, so we ordered a Russian salad for two, 3 gazpachos and a croquettes. To see how. Everything is mini. The gazpacho with a garlic flavor that diluted the possible tomato. The ordinary mini salad. The mini croquettes rich and creamy, but scarce. Two mini yogurts on a biscuit base. 45 euros. As we arrived early, there was no fuss. The wait was to pay again.I don't mind paying if the service and quality is commensurate with the prices. In this case, it is not so. So I can neither recommend it nor will we return.\n",
      "Cozy place, good service and presentation\n",
      "Terrible everything. A SINGLE SECOND DISH, of excellent quality, yes. A 1 kg ribeye that forces you to share it with someone who likes meat to the same extent as you. For the price you pay, the menu is sooooo limited. I wish I could have chosen, not something else, but something. I don't put a 0 because there isn't one.\n",
      "Charming place and taking care of all the details. The exquisite food. We tried the Samantha menu and it was well worth it. (The best the grilled meat and the piquillo peppers). We will be back without a doubt.\n",
      "Amazing place, very cozy, excellent cuisine and service. We will certainly repeat, a wonderful experience. Leeks and French toast TOP.\n",
      "Really cozy. With taste and style. A marvel. The food is well prepared and lives up to expectations. The delicious meat, the unbeatable anchovies, the impressive croquettes and so on, everything we've tried. It is worth going. All very friendly and attentive. And the town is beautiful. Do not miss it.\n",
      "Prices of 5 üåü .. in a media tavern.All service and presentation details are missing. Cold place .Correct expensive and scarce food.Sincerely regrettable the visit of Samantha who does not listen to or admit the criticism.Much to learn ... but it will take time because unfortunately the client is not right.\n",
      "Wonderful treatment and spectacular ribeye. The only downside of the Tavern are the tables, a bit uncomfortable, very authentic but uncomfortable\n",
      "The experience has exceeded all our expectations. The site has a special charm in the heart of Pedraza. The unbeatable service, super attentive and pleasant. And the food is very good, the steak with very top peppers. Highly recommended site\n",
      "I give it a star because it cannot be put less. I went to have a coffee with baileys and it was bad, it was cut, the coffee was lumpy and it tasted sour so I couldn't finish it. My stomach started to hurt shortly after I left, and I threw myself all night vomiting and feeling very unwell. I'm sure I won't be back.\n",
      "Friendly, good service, good place to eat.\n",
      "Very friendly staff.It is endearing to see Samanta out there talking with clients or friends, with her children, carrying paintings that she has bought, with the bike ... (very cool, by the way).Everything we ate was very good but I will be critical, I hope constructively:- the prices a bit expensive.- Snacks: very liquid chocolate (it is + good thick but looks like a Colacao), missing biscuits on 2 occasions and cake of the day on one.- croquettes: the spherical shape will never be like the traditional one.- the black bar, the decoration etc ... brutal (the touch of the flowers on the balconies breaks the sobriety of the fa√ßade: a good idea).I would lower prices but the atmosphere of good vibes that the team gives off (waiters / flush, cook) is what I prefer.And I suspect that behind these merits is the hand of Samantha, who is a very intelligent, hard-working and very human woman ...One from Manresa tells you ... I hope I was not reckless or lacking with the comments.HEALTH and many successes to the team !!\n",
      "We have spent one night at the hotel and we have dined in the tavern and all of 100. The super careful service, the wonderful place and the beautiful town! Thanks!!!\n",
      "Little food and expensive\n",
      "Some friends recommended the place to me and the truth is that you eat very well, quality products and very attentive service. We will be back!\n",
      "Visit more than a must in Pedraza. Product of 10 and an unbeatable service. Looking forward to coming back soon.\n",
      "The place is fantastic, the service is perfect, with very good treatment and the food is great. To repeat without a doubt.\n",
      "Very expensive to spend one night at the Casa Taberna hotel, like ‚Ç¨ 400! Not that I was going to sleep in a golden bed! The top restaurant !!\n"
