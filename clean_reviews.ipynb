I ate a gourmet tour through Barcelona, ​​starting with Sanpol de Mar, the most beautiful seaside town in Barcelona. In Sanpol de Mar, the freshness of the ingredients is maximized, especially the fish dishes have a good texture, and the light sauce adds the flavor of the fish. The fusion cuisine of Tokyo and Sanpol de Mar was truly creative. The combination of Japanese tadaki and soy sauce, kale and romasco sauce was the best! In Barcelona, ​​food was refined and neatly presented as a world-class gourmet city. When you go to Michelin, you may be too embarrassed to experience an experiment, or the display may be out of taste. However, Momentz offers food that will satisfy both those who have never experienced Michelin and those who have experienced it a lot.

Perhaps the most innovative concept is that the \"head waiter\", \"meter\" and \"waiter\" disappear, here the way to communicate with the restaurant is also this. At all times you choose, order and order the dishes and drinks through the interactive table, which they have to adjust, as on several occasions we received the drinks late and untimely.

Potser el concepte més innovador és que el \"cap de sala\", \"metre\" i \"cambrer\" desapareix, aquí la forma de comunicar-se amb el restaurant també és aquesta. En tot moment esculls, demanes i encarregues els plats i les begudes a traves de la taula interactiva, fet que han d'acabar d'ajustar, ja que en diverses ocasions vam rebre les begudes tard i a destemps. És un canvi de concepte, i sabent que les comandes van directament a la cuina sorprèn que no es millori en eficiència. Es perd una mica el tracte humà amb el servei.Pel que fa al menjar, els plats tenen preus en concordança amb la zona i l'experiència tecnològica. Les racions són prou contundents i de qualitat. Les begudes tenen un preu una mica alt, però la cervesa NUA té molt bon sabor i els mojitos i còctels també estan bé.En general una experiència positiva amb alguns punts de millora, però que ens mostra com podrien ser els restaurants en un futur no molt llunyà. => Restaurant with a different restaurant concept, where the tech concept is explored in every way.We live in an age hyperconnected to our mobile and electronic devices, but paradoxically this environment helps us interact with each other more than it may seem leaving our terminals aside.The tables are large interactive screens where you can play, share and connect with other diners.

      "(Translated by Google) With a table reserved at 3pm we had half an hour waiting on the street. Once at the table we made and paid for the order and 40 min later, when we complained, we were told that they had a computer problem and it had not reached them in the kitchen. One of the dishes we ordered came without one of the main ingredients ... The manager told us that he would give us the dessert and in the truth he would give us a discount the next time we came back. We refused and said they would pass the incident on to the bosses. Two weeks later they still hadn't told me anything and I wrote. The summary? That it's the fault of technology, COVID or global warming, but that they do it very well and put a lot of effort into it. They offer me a discount so I can go back to their place. All in Spanish, of course. Oh, and with his email I discovered that from the moment you walk in the door until you leave, there are security cameras recording you. From what I’ve been reading it wasn’t just the day I went there, that these incidents occurred.

Un dels plats que vam demanar venia sense un dels ingredients principals ... El manager ens va dir que ens regalava ell les postres i a l’hora de la veritat ens donava un descompte per la propera vegada que tornessim. Ens hi vam negar i van dir que passarien la incidència als caps. Dues setmanes més tard encara no m’havien dit res i vaig escriure jo. El resum? Que és culpa de la tecnologia, del COVID o de l’escalfament global, però que ells ho fan molt bé i s’hi esforcen molt. Que m’ofereixen un descompte perquè torni al seu local. Tot en castellà, per descomptat. Ah, i amb el seu mail vaig descobrir que, des que entres per la porta fins que marxes, hi ha càmeres de seguretat gravant-te. Pel que he estat llegint no va ser només el dia que jo vaig anar-hi, que es van donar aquestes incidències.

QA dessert brought him a lighted sparkler and put him the song \"Happy Birthday\". He freaked out. The food although a hair expensive, for my taste I understand that the place deserves it.\n",

      "(Translated by Google) The food is very good. We've ordered sirloin, chicken, and tuna tacos to share. The tacos were delicious, my recommendation is the sirloin. They are accompanied with a sauce that gives them a fresh touch. I had tuna tartare for the main dish and my friend salmon. She highly recommends the salmon tartare. Finally we ordered the cheese cake, which along with the taquitos, is the best. The cheese cake is delicious and very creamy (and fresh that goes very well now in summer). I came for the experience of the smart tables but I also have a very good experience of the food.The smart table also has a super comfortable function and that is that by synchronizing the table with the mobile, you can pay from the mobile without having to take the card out of the bag, or wait for them to attend to pay the bill, it is instantaneous (It is also a good measure for COVID).In general, my assessment is very positive and I will surely repeat the experience.(Original)La comida está muy buena.

Everything is displayed on the digital table, which by the way is a bit dizzy. After sitting down, you have to pair your phone with the table (I didn't like it that much). You order through the digital table without knowing very well what, since to order a menu, you must first have studied the dishes separately. There is no specification in the menu of dishes or supplements. When you finish selecting everything, remembering what the initial menu costs, you do the subtraction and you know how much more expensive the dish you have chosen is. The food itself is good, the quality product. For my taste it is a very limited offer. As you criticize some dish, I would say that the fruit salad, which by the way is called almost the same as a mochi, was very good, but they have not removed the durices and there has been a piece of crust that has reminded me that I should go to the dentist. Having a digital table under the food is a bad idea, the dishes that you require to eat with your hands taste like hydroalcoholic gel ... a shame. You had to know the experience ...

Pues está seria la descripción mas gráfica. Todo está expuesto en la mesa digital, que porcierto, marea un poco. Después de sentarse, tienes que vincular tu telefono con la mesa( no me ha gustado mucho). Pides mediante la mesa digital sin saber muy bien el qué, ya que para pedir un menú, antes debes haberte estudiado los platos a parte. No hay especificación en el menú ni de platos, ni de suplementos. Cuando terminas de seleccionarlo todo, acordándote de lo que cuesta el menú inicial, le haces la resta y sabes cuánto más caro es el plato que has escogido. La comida en si está buena, el producto de calidad. Para mi gusto es una oferta muy limitada. Como critica a algún plato, diría que la macedonia, que porcierto se llama casi igual que un mochi, estaba muy buena, pero, no han quitado las duricias y ha quedado algun trozo de corteza que me ha recordado que debo ir al dentista. Tener una mesa digital debajo de la comida es mala idea, los platos que requieren para comer con tus manos, saben a gel hidroalcohólico.. una pena. Había que conocer la experiencia...

Forse ci vorrebbe più Catalunya! Unica pecca i tavoli piccoli e un poco scomodi. Assolutamente da provare almeno una sera! Decisamente consigliato! @gargio76 => Beautiful, small, cozy, welcoming, warm and peaceful atmospheric restaurant. Perfect for a pleasant couple dinner. Young staff very friendly and always available. Dishes offered of excellent quality at a really low price. Mix of tradition and innovation between Barcelona and Italy. Maybe Catalunya would take more! The only flaw is the small and somewhat uncomfortable tables. Absolutely to try at least one evening! Definitely recommended! @ gargio76\n",

If we don't like something on the menu, they change it for something else and also ask about allergies.

Un sitio muy recomendable, sobre todo para eventos especiales. => Hemranos Torres KitchenA very elegant and luxurious restaurant with a modern, elegant, but at the same time informal atmosphere. The cooking show is an incomparable show. The food is exquisite, each dish is a surprise, even the simplest dishes are combined with exotic seasonings that give them an extraordinary and amazing taste of high quality. My favorite is the sunflower ice cream. I loved it. Very attentive and friendly service that explains each dish (what it contains and how they suggest eating it). If we don't like something on the menu, they change it for something else and also ask about allergies. The Torres Brothers themselves go to the tables and ask all the customers if they liked the dinner. High prices but in accordance with the quality and high level service. A highly recommended site, especially for special events.\n",

      "(Translated by Google) The lousy customer treatment at least one of the blonde waitresses with curly hair, you ask her for something and you're not done yet, she leaves. You ask that your ear be done WELL and they bring you preheated, and you ask them to do more and it begins to say that it has to be bathed in oil that way. Well, I tell you one thing, I work in restaurants in Madrid and if they ask you well, check it out or if it takes twice and you don't make excuses “yes, gelatin” “yes, it's Galician style”. It seems that he can get to argue with you. It is better not to ask for beer with lemon because it is pure lemon! Alioli, my goodness, is another matter. It is mayonnaise with garlic powder and it costs 1.50 euros, AWESOME !!! That aioli has to come with cuttlefish! Anyway! We will not return and do not recommend it.(Original)El trato al cliente pésimo al menos unas de las camareras rubia con pelo rizado, le pides algo y aún no has terminado se va.

Pues os digo una cosa he trabajo en restaurantes en Madrid y si te piden bien echa lo haces o si hace falta dos veces y no pones excusas “que si gelatina” “que si es a la gallega”. Parece que puede llegar a discutir contigo. Cerveza con limón mejor no pedirla porque es puro limón!!! Alioli, madre mía, es otro tema. Es mayonesa con ajo en polvo y cuesta 1,50 euros, FlIPANTE!!!

We also ordered the beef chop to the point, for three times, and finally it arrived very made and in hot stone, with which the meat was spoiled.

Pedimos una serie de platos para compartir, explícitamente escogimos sin frutos secos y lo comentamos debido a que era por una alergia; igualmente nos llegó una ensalada con avellanas, que tuvimos que devolver. Pedimos también la chuleta de vaca al punto, por tres veces, y finalmente llegó muy hecha y en piedra caliente, con lo que la carne se echó a perder. Lo comentamos, nos pidieron disculpas pero nos acabamos comiendo la chuleta pasada de 59 euros. El resto de comida muy bien y el lugar chulo. Mejoraría si abriesen la zona de la piscina.

      "(Translated by Google) Dinner at alkostat, a restaurant attached to the Michelin star Alkimia, which you have little or nothing to envy.A place that is worth visiting both for the facilities (located in a perfectly preserved old building) and for the quality of the food.We started with a grilled oyster with scrambled eggs. Amazing taste. Different. Essential.We continue with some al dente beans with an almost mashed potato and accompanied by butifarra de perol. Apparently simple dish but that shows its great cuisine. Simple and complex at the same time.As meat we have SPECTACULAR gizzards. The pity is that they are part of the ephemeral of the letter. Soft in flavor and texture but with powerful flavor ravioli that give depth to the entire preparation.We finish with a grilled sea bream and its pil pil. Spectacular. The best fish I have had in Barcelona. Perfect point of the fish and great grilled flavor not at all masked with the pil pil. More to more, price adjusted for the size of the portion.Very good experience to which I would only put two buts: extremely expensive wine list (a glass of wine 12 euros) and perhaps a bit slow in service.Price of € 115.5 for 3 people.

Sorprendente sabor. Distinto. Imprescindible.Seguimos con unas judías al dente con una patata casi en puré y acompañada de butifarra de perol. Plato aparentemente simple pero que demuestra su gran cocina. Sencillo y complejo al mismo tiempo.Como carne tomamos unas mollejas ESPECTACULARES. La pena es que forman parte de los efímeros de la carta. Suaves en sabor y textura pero con unos raviolis potentes de sabor que dan profundidad a toda la elaboración.Terminamos con un besugo a la brasa y su pil pil. Espectacular. El mejor pescado que he tomado en Barcelona. Punto perfecto del pescado y gran sabor a brasa para nada enmascarado con el pil pil. A más a más, precio ajustado para el tamaño de la ración.Experiencia muy buena a la que sólo pondría dos peros: carta de vinos extremadamente cara (una copa de vino 12 euros) y quizás un tanto lentos en el servicio.Precio de 115,5€ para 3 personas.

Pescados salvajes muy ricos pero ojo!!!! Que el precio vuela…. Sin duda es la gran especialidad… pero ajustar algo respecto la cantidad sería un acierto. Postres buenos, pero hay detalles que un buen gallego debería pulir… la tarta Santiago directamente con vino de meus amores … como antaño… y hubiera sido un detalle acabar invitando con un orujito… son detalles.En resumen … la calidad del producto es muy buena en especial los pescados… pero el precio…más que para locales está previsto para turistas, aunque dado el front office la clientela es clásica ya que no tiene un frontal vistoso. En mi opinión, personal y con respeto… se han dejado llevar algo por el cambio urbanístico de la zona con restaurantes claramente focalizados al turismo con precios elevados.

Because there are so many choices in Chinese food, I am now trying to try different dishes from different countries in my hometown. Recently I have a special love for Thai food curry.\n",
