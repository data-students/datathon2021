desserts, cake 3 milks, torrejas in honey among many more ... they are not typical Honduran dishes, another very different thing is that the dish that you like most like the baleadas is not every day,

Highlighting first of all the attention of all the staff and the kind treatment received at all times, always willing to what you need, is something that seems obvious that it must be so but in many good hotels it does not happen. The hotel has a minimalist Japanese design but with all the amenities you may need. The beds are very comfortable in which rest is guaranteed. Everything is thought that the client is comfortable during their stay. Both the lights and the curtains work with buttons, which at first cost me a little to understand the operation, but with a little trial everything is solved. Finally the food, who has been in a Nobu restaurant knows what is hidden behind, the product is unbeatable and the production is incredible. The sushi bar is second to none if you don't go to Japan. The room service is also very good. For breakfast I would recommend the eggs Benedict. I forgot to highlight the incredible views of Barcelona and the good existing communications being located next to the Sants station.

I was very surprised that nobody complained, they waited patiently for them to be served, families with children, couples, workers, tourists. Suddenly the food began to come out completing tables. There are no words to describe how immensely good and how well presented the dish was. Well yes very very very good.A quality and an incredible price, it is worth moving from the opposite point of Barcelona or coming from far away expressly, because it does not disappoint and leaves no one indifferent. Restaurants in Barcelona are raffled to Filipino chefs, they sign chefs from the Asian country for their expertise in preparing classic and modern dishes of Spanish cuisine.They are reputed to be honest, reliable, hardworking and above all to know how to trace the recipes with extreme precision.

It turns out that the bar seating was closer to the source; where all the action happens. I ordered a gazpacho as my drink and it was really flavorful. Embracing the red fruit, commonly known as a vegetable, we then ate the famous simple traditional Spanish dish: tomato bread. One of the tapas had all eyes on me, literally. I loved the breaded shrimps but this was one shrimp tapa I could not bear to maintain eye contact with. Finally, the Crema Catalana was the something sweet I decided to eat; pardon the rhyming. Unfortunately, the sweetness was masked by a sort of mixture of gasoline-like and something burnt taste.

Feeling a little skeptical of all the high ratings, we decided to try it out and see for ourselves. I have to say, what the masses say is true. This place is amazing. We had Moises as our waiter and he was a huge part on why we decided to come back again on our last night in Barcelona. His customer service was outstanding and we loved his laid back vibe. If you go, ask for Moises!We ordered the ceviche, some combination plates, and the mixed fried rice. As others have mentioned, the portions are BIG. There was a lot of prawns and tuna in the ceviche and it had great flavor. My dish was the fried bream with the avocado salad. We all agreed that the avocado salad was amazing. Lots and lots of avocado and it was a refreshing way to start the meal. The fish came out steaming hot and perfectly cooked. We all shared the mixed fried rice and devoured as much as we could.

We had the tartare de tomate with small toast, it had tomatoes, avocado, cucumber and other great things, yes great as well. We had the mussels with fries in a delicious sauce. We had the garbanzo- Gaxpasto soup which was good, cold soup. Cannoli, there was some pasta with oxtail, so tender and delicious! We had croquettes, they had chicken filling inside and they come 2 per serving. I had a beer with like lemon juice, it was good. Then came the brownie with ice cream and white chocolate!

And they poured whisky on my ice cream. \ud83d\udc4d"}, {"user": {"name": "Christopher Skapski", "link": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116429489333258895267?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi33aOl_P7zAhWVlGoFHdvjBRUQvvQBegUIARCcAQ", "thumbnail": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiDdb2CvJsIsuHhmN4uGzilguRfLC-7JbcfGfFZrA=s40-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100", "local_guide": true, "reviews": 15, "photos": 4}, "rating": 5.0, "date": "2 months ago", "snippet": "The food: \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 The staff : \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f"}, {"user": {"name": "Jean-Philippe Bouillot", "link": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118000062676302705558?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwitnNGl_P7zAhV7mWoFHVx8BhkQvvQBegQIARAs", "thumbnail": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjYDVYnZEnInZLNxG8Qj_GLQgQaVQPoD_U_l6qqGg=s40-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100", "local_guide": true, "reviews": 47, "photos": 128}, "rating": 5.0, "date": "4 years ago", "snippet": "The best argentinian in Barcelona!

Very cozy little get away from the crowds and noise.Our order was taken by one of the owners who was very personable and with fantastic service! The food was delicious. If you want a good steak, look no further. Their pasta is made from scratch. Everything we had was bursting with flavor. Savor every bite. Portions are very grand. Not typical gourmet tiny but not huge either. Just right.We felt welcomed and part of the atmosphere. As if we were extended family! You could tell they loved their customers.

Unfortunately the food and consequently the service was severely lacking. After some mediocre tapas starters we had a Tortilla and a Camembert salad for our main. The Camembert was breaded and deep-fried within an inch of its life, it came out extremely greasy. The salad, while not unpleasant, was just leaves and a few oily nuts. The Spanish omelette was very undercooked to the point it was inedible slop on a board. We asked for this to be cooked again and it returned hardly any more done. After picking at a small bit of the better done part of the omelette we abandoned it, raw egg and salmonella is never good before flying. The bill came and I asked if the tortilla could be taken off the bill. This was promptly ignored at the bill was brought unamended. I asked for it to be to removed and the waiter was most indignant stating we had tried it so it can not come off the bill. After several awkward minutes arguing about it we paid the full amount. There are many great restaurants in Barcelona, this one is best avoided.", "likes": 3}, {"user": {"name": "Gav Jam", "link": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107014261459560862602?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjg6fXb8_7zAhXmmOAKHRbeAswQvvQBegUIARCXAQ", "thumbnail": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GheABVZeUuJ0itvy_pCx8Un5JH0fLsyyfe5D4YEOI0=s40-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100", "local_guide": true, "reviews": 82, "photos": 71}, "rating": 5.0, "date": "a year ago", "snippet": "Very nice restaurant, lovely quiet environment, gentle music and polite staff.

The quality and taste of the food is outstanding! The service is very attentive and superb (a rare find in Barcelona). The space feels so authentic. The price of the food is way less for the quality of food that you\u2019re receiving. I ate the salad with goat cheese (the best goat cheese I ever had. Didn\u2019t taste pungent. And it\u2019s so good I ate it anyways even though I\u2019m lactose intolerant lol). I also had the sole fish with olive paste. DELICIOUS! I also ate the mushroom and sausage ravioli with the mushroom sauce, and that was the best. You can tell the pasta is made fresh, AND the sausage taste wasn\u2019t over powering the mushroom taste and sauce. My husband had the rib eye and it was the perfect size meet and cooked perfectly: not over cooked at all.

Just sitting down they bring you some sticks and bread that already cheer you up, I have always liked them, while you read the Letter. I accompanied them by ordering the Parmesan cheese tapa that is accompanied with a sauce of balsamic vinegar of Modena. I, of course, dressed them and it was, I recommend it.The menu is very extensive: the Barcelona menu with tapas, typical dishes such as broken eggs, escudella ... Although I chose Italian dishes from Milan. It has sorprised me for good!The burrata with confit tomato is delicious and generous in measure. A dish to share that will not leave you indifferent.Second, I ordered some lobster spaghetti that were not on the menu, but I do not regret ordering. Delicious Although it raised the average price of food, they are so rich that you forget.If you order \u00e0 la carte, the average price is 15 euros for a second course, so value for money is more than correct. The lobster came out at 40, but it is lobster.For dessert and to top it off I ordered the classic Tiramisu but the restaurant presents it in the form of an original long meringue. Be careful, share it if you don't want to go out in a balloon. A real pleasure bomb !!!. The coffee-flavored mascapne left me the best of flavors.I will repeat.

Out of embarrassment, my friend gave her a tip which I am very angry about as this was in front of other customers who wanted a quiet, peaceful evening. She is a bully. She shouted at other staff members (the younger, male waiters working on Sunday night from 9pm were fantastic and super nice) and slammed menus on the table next to us. It is obvious this woman had a major problem and I believe it should be addressed. I will not be returning to your restaurant which is disappointing considering that it is so highly rated.", "response": {"date": "2 years ago", "snippet": "Hi Tommy,We are very sorry to read your comment and see your bad experience in our restaurant.

I mean..As to the waiting time, I get that you can be super-busy during certain periods of the day, but it happened to me already twice (in past two weeks) that the waiting wasn't flagged, we ordered food and waited an entire hour.By simply flagging this some people would leave being completely happy, but in my humble opinion this should be flagged upfront at all times.", "response": {"date": "3 years ago", "snippet": "Dear Kitti,Thanks for your comments.We have to tell you that the woks we are cooking in Woki Organic Market are the same ones we have been doing since we started this project more than 6 years ago.We have always been known for making abundant and tasty woks but in the end it is always a matter of personal tastes and perceptions, we hope you can come back to savor our woksRegarding the waits, we will try to review the protocols of the waiters' commands as well as in the kitchen to see if we can avoid delays, but when the restaurant is full, as we always cook the woks at the moment that implies that sometimes there are delays, but it is not the usual scenario.We also inform you that when there is a collapse in the wok kitchen or any other kitchen, the waiters always warn our customers.

We were concerned whether we would be disappointed again with a restaurant located in a tourist district and menus in several languages available.Thankfully, it was good. The paella took a while but it was worth it, the rice was done right and flavourful. The seafood and meat had the right textures and was cooked beautifully.Before the paellas we also had a really nice Cava Sangria and a refreshing and savoury gazpacho to share.We completed the meal with a Catalan Cream Brulee which was also delicious, not too sweet and with the right texture.

A group of about 13 friends traveled to Barcelona for a birthday trip. Seating such a large group was prompt. Upon entering my boyfriend had a small luggage that we had recently purchased. The hostess, approached him and due to the language barrier we couldn\u2019t understand what she was asking so we waited and then when told where the table was, we started to walk. She then raised her voice and asked referring to my boyfriend, \u201cIs he always like this?\u201d. I asked her what she was trying to relay and then we understood that she wanted to check the bag. A simple situation immediately turned hostile.The process of ordering went well! I ordered the salmon and veggies. The salmon had NO seasoning. The portion size was decent. The ambiance was very nice and a DJ was setting up in our area as well for later hours I\u2019m assuming.Towards the end of dinner, a friend asked the Manager if they offered anything FREE for birthdays. He advised that he would locate something. A couple of minutes thereafter we were brought out champagne flutes for a toast. Prior to drinking them we inquired on who ordered them and were they free. Our server advised us not to worry about anything. So we proceeded with the toast. A couple of minutes after that we were brought 6 different desserts to sample. Again, we asked who ordered them and if they were free and we received the same response.After we received the bill, we noticed that the champagne and desserts were charged. My friend immediately spoke with the manager Juan and the waiter regarding the charges. After discussing the issues for about 30 mins, she was told that NOTHING is ever free and they would accept half of the charges. After all of the bills were paid, the manager Juan brought out a round of shots to the table as a \u201cbandaid\u201d regarding the issue.I would not recommend this restaurant to ANY tourist based upon the lack of service, deception, and quality of food. This was definitely not a memorable experience. The food was also pricey in comparison to the quality."}, {"user": {"name": "Alfredo Estrada", "link": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117773778605465738657?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8mYrj-_7zAhWH6p4KHWnjCtoQvvQBegQIARBZ", "thumbnail": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiEmu00YvOrn_NiE2BaA68bU-XFR8uDoqi2N7j2AQ=s40-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100", "local_guide": true, "reviews": 176, "photos": 60}, "rating": 5.0, "date": "2 years ago", "snippet": "Vert nice food and service.
